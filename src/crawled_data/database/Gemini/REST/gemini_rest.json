Learn more Home Gemini API Models Send feedback Text generation Python Node.js Go REST The Gemini API can generate text output when provided text, images, video, and\naudio as input. This guide shows you how to generate text using the generateContent and streamGenerateContent methods. To learn about working with Gemini's vision and audio capabilities,\nrefer to the Vision and Audio guides. Generate text from text-only input The simplest way to generate text using the Gemini API is to provide the model\nwith a single text-only input, as shown in this example: curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [{ \"parts\":[{\"text\": \"Write a story about a magic backpack.\"}] }] }' 2 > /dev/null text_generation.sh In this case, the prompt (\"Explain how AI works\") doesn't\ninclude any output examples, system instructions, or formatting information.\nIt's a zero-shot approach. For some use cases, a one-shot or few-shot prompt\nmight produce output that's more aligned with user expectations. In some cases,\nyou might also want to provide system instructions to help the model\nunderstand the task or follow specific guidelines. Generate text from text-and-image input The Gemini API supports multimodal inputs that combine text with media files.\nThe following example shows how to generate text from text-and-image input: # Use a temporary file to hold the base64 encoded image data TEMP_B64 = $( mktemp ) trap 'rm -f \"$TEMP_B64\"' EXIT\nbase64 $B64FLAGS $IMG_PATH > \" $TEMP_B64 \" # Use a temporary file to hold the JSON payload TEMP_JSON = $( mktemp ) trap 'rm -f \"$TEMP_JSON\"' EXIT\n\ncat > \" $TEMP_JSON \" << EOF { \"contents\" : [{ \"parts\" : [ { \"text\" : \"Tell me about this instrument\" } , { \"inline_data\" : { \"mime_type\" : \"image/jpeg\" , \"data\" : \" $( cat \" $TEMP_B64 \" ) \" } } ] }] } EOF\n\ncurl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d \"@ $TEMP_JSON \" 2 > /dev/null text_generation.sh As with text-only prompting, multimodal prompting can involve various approaches\nand refinements. Depending on the output from this example, you might want to\nadd steps to the prompt or be more specific in your instructions. To learn more,\nsee File prompting strategies . Generate a text stream By default, the model returns a response after completing the entire text\ngeneration process. You can achieve faster interactions by not waiting for the\nentire result, and instead use streaming to handle partial results. The following example shows how to implement streaming using the streamGenerateContent method to\ngenerate text from a text-only input prompt. curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse&key= ${ GOOGLE_API_KEY } \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --no-buffer \\ -d '{ \"contents\":[{\"parts\":[{\"text\": \"Write a story about a magic backpack.\"}]}]}' text_generation.sh Build an interactive chat The Gemini SDK lets you collect multiple rounds of questions\nand responses, allowing users to step incrementally toward answers or get help\nwith multipart problems. This SDK feature provides an interface to keep\ntrack of conversations history, but behind the scenes uses the same generateContent method to create the response. The following code example shows a basic chat implementation: curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key = $GOOGLE_API_KEY \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [ {\"role\":\"user\", \"parts\":[{ \"text\": \"Hello\"}]}, {\"role\": \"model\", \"parts\":[{ \"text\": \"Great to meet you. What would you like to know?\"}]}, {\"role\":\"user\", \"parts\":[{ \"text\": \"I have two dogs in my house. How many paws are in my house?\"}]}, ] }' 2 > /dev/null | grep \"text\" chat.sh Enable chat streaming You can also use streaming with chat, as shown in the following example: curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:streamGenerateContent?alt = sse&key = $GOOGLE_API_KEY \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [ {\"role\":\"user\", \"parts\":[{ \"text\": \"Hello\"}]}, {\"role\": \"model\", \"parts\":[{ \"text\": \"Great to meet you. What would you like to know?\"}]}, {\"role\":\"user\", \"parts\":[{ \"text\": \"I have two dogs in my house. How many paws are in my house?\"}]}, ] }' 2 > /dev/null | grep \"text\" chat.sh Configure text generation Every prompt you send to the model includes\nparameters that control how the model generates responses. You can use GenerationConfig to\nconfigure these parameters. If you don't configure the parameters, the model\nuses default options, which can vary by model. The following example shows how to configure several of the available options. curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key = $GOOGLE_API_KEY \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [{ \"parts\":[ {\"text\": \"Write a story about a magic backpack.\"} ] }], \"safetySettings\": [ { \"category\": \"HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT\", \"threshold\": \"BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH\" } ], \"generationConfig\": { \"stopSequences\": [ \"Title\" ], \"temperature\": 1.0, \"maxOutputTokens\": 800, \"topP\": 0.8, \"topK\": 10 } }' 2 > /dev/null | grep \"text\" configure_model_parameters.sh stopSequences specifies the set of character sequences (up to 5) that will\nstop output generation. If specified, the API will stop at the first appearance\nof a stop_sequence . The stop sequence won't be included as part of the\nresponse. temperature controls the randomness of the output. Use higher values for more\ncreative responses, and lower values for more deterministic responses. Values\ncan range from [0.0, 2.0]. maxOutputTokens sets the maximum number of tokens to include in a candidate. topP changes how the model selects tokens for output. Tokens are selected from\nthe most to least probable until the sum of their probabilities equals the topP value. The default topP value is 0.95. topK changes how the model selects tokens for output. A topK of 1 means the\nselected token is the most probable among all the tokens in the model's\nvocabulary, while a topK of 3 means that the next token is selected from among\nthe 3 most probable using the temperature. Tokens are\nfurther filtered based on topP with the final token selected using temperature\nsampling.

Learn more Home Gemini API Models Send feedback Explore vision capabilities with the Gemini API Python Node.js Go REST The Gemini API is able to process images and videos, enabling a multitude of\n exciting developer use cases. Some of Gemini's vision capabilities include\n the ability to: Caption and answer questions about images Transcribe and reason over PDFs, including long documents up to 2 million token context window Describe, segment, and extract information from videos,\nincluding both visual frames and audio, up to 90 minutes long Detect objects in an image and return bounding box coordinates for them This tutorial demonstrates some possible ways to prompt the Gemini API with\nimages and video input, provides code examples,\nand outlines prompting best practices with multimodal vision capabilities.\nAll output is text-only. Before you begin: Set up your project and API key Before calling the Gemini API, you need to set up your project and configure\nyour API key. Expand to view how to set up your project and API key Tip: For complete setup instructions, see the Gemini API quickstart . Get and secure your API key You need an API key to call the Gemini API. If you don't already have one,\ncreate a key in Google AI Studio. Get an API key It's strongly recommended that you do not check an API key into your version\ncontrol system. This tutorial assumes that you're accessing your API key as an environment\nvariable. Prompting with images In this tutorial, you will upload images using the File API or as inline data\nand generate content based on those images. Technical details (images) Gemini 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash support a maximum of 3,600 image files. Images must be in one of the following image data MIME types: PNG - image/png JPEG - image/jpeg WEBP - image/webp HEIC - image/heic HEIF - image/heif Each image is equivalent to 258 tokens. While there are no specific limits to the number of pixels in an image besides\nthe model's context window, larger images are scaled down to a maximum\nresolution of 3072x3072 while preserving their original aspect ratio, while\nsmaller images are scaled up to 768x768 pixels. There is no cost reduction\nfor images at lower sizes, other than bandwidth, or performance improvement\nfor images at higher resolution. For best results: Rotate images to the correct orientation before uploading. Avoid blurry images. If using a single image, place the text prompt after the image. Image input For total image payload size less than 20MB, we recommend either uploading\nbase64 encoded images or directly uploading locally stored image files. Base64 encoded images You can upload public image URLs by encoding them as Base64 payloads.\nWe recommend using the httpx library to fetch the image URLs.\nThe following code example shows how to do this: IMG_PATH = /path/to/your/image1.jpeg if [[ \" $( base64 --version 2>&1 ) \" = * \"FreeBSD\" * ]] ; then B64FLAGS = \"--input\" else B64FLAGS = \"-w0\" fi curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [{ \"parts\":[ {\"text\": \"Caption this image.\"}, { \"inline_data\": { \"mime_type\":\"image/jpeg\", \"data\": \"' \\$ ( base64 \\$ B64FLAGS \\$ IMG_PATH ) '\" } } ] }] }' 2 > /dev/null Multiple images To prompt with multiple images in Base64 encoded format, you can do the\nfollowing: IMAGE_PATH_1 = /path/to/your/image1.jpeg IMAGE_PATH_2 = /path/to/your/image2.jpeg if [[ \" $( base64 --version 2>&1 ) \" = * \"FreeBSD\" * ]] ; then B64FLAGS = \"--input\" else B64FLAGS = \"-w0\" fi curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [{ \"parts\":[ { \"inline_data\": { \"mime_type\": \"image/jpeg\", \"data\": \"' \\$ ( base64 $B64FLAGS \" $IMAGE_PATH_1 \" ) '\" } }, { \"inline_data\": { \"mime_type\": \"image/png\", \"data\": \"' \\$ ( base64 $B64FLAGS \" $IMAGE_PATH_2 \" ) '\" } }, { \"text\": \"Generate a list of all the objects contained in both images.\" } ] }] }' 2 > /dev/null Upload an image and generate content When the combination of files and system instructions that you intend to send is\nlarger than 20 MB in size, use the File API to upload those files. Use the media.upload method of the File API to upload an image of any size. Note: The File API lets you store up to 20 GB of files per project, with a\nper-file maximum size of 2 GB. Files are stored for 48 hours. They can be\naccessed in that period with your API key, but cannot be downloaded from the\nAPI. It is available at no cost in all regions where the Gemini API is\navailable. After uploading the file, you can make GenerateContent requests that reference\nthe File API URI. Select the generative model and provide it with a text prompt\nand the uploaded image. MIME_TYPE = $( file -b --mime-type \" ${ IMG_PATH_2 } \" ) NUM_BYTES = $( wc -c < \" ${ IMG_PATH_2 } \" ) DISPLAY_NAME = TEXT tmp_header_file = upload-header.tmp # Initial resumable request defining metadata. # The upload url is in the response headers dump them to a file. curl \" ${ BASE_URL } /upload/v1beta/files?key= ${ GOOGLE_API_KEY } \" \\ -D upload-header.tmp \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Protocol: resumable\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Command: start\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Length: ${ NUM_BYTES } \" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Type: ${ MIME_TYPE } \" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"{'file': {'display_name': ' ${ DISPLAY_NAME } '}}\" 2 > /dev/null upload_url = $( grep -i \"x-goog-upload-url: \" \" ${ tmp_header_file } \" | cut -d \" \" -f2 | tr -d \"\\r\" ) rm \" ${ tmp_header_file } \" # Upload the actual bytes. curl \" ${ upload_url } \" \\ -H \"Content-Length: ${ NUM_BYTES } \" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Offset: 0\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Command: upload, finalize\" \\ --data-binary \"@ ${ IMG_PATH_2 } \" 2 > /dev/null > file_info.json file_uri = $( jq \".file.uri\" file_info.json ) echo file_uri = $file_uri # Now generate content using that file curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [{ \"parts\":[ {\"text\": \"Can you tell me about the instruments in this photo?\"}, {\"file_data\": {\"mime_type\": \"image/jpeg\", \"file_uri\": ' $file_uri '} }] }] }' 2 > /dev/null > response.json\n\ncat response.json echo jq \".candidates[].content.parts[].text\" response.json files.sh Verify image file upload and get metadata You can verify the API successfully stored the uploaded file and get its\nmetadata by calling files.get . Only the name (and by extension, the uri ) are unique. name = $( jq \".file.name\" file_info.json ) # Get the file of interest to check state curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files/ $name > file_info.json # Print some information about the file you got name = $( jq \".file.name\" file_info.json ) echo name = $name file_uri = $( jq \".file.uri\" file_info.json ) echo file_uri = $file_uri files .sh OpenAI Compatibility You can access Gemini's image understanding capabilities using the\nOpenAI libraries. This lets you integrate Gemini into existing\nOpenAI workflows by updating three lines of code and using\nyour Gemini API key. See the Image understanding example for code demonstrating how to send images encoded as Base64 payloads. Capabilities This section outlines specific vision capabilities of the Gemini model,\nincluding object detection and bounding box coordinates. Get a bounding box for an object Gemini models are trained to return bounding box coordinates as relative widths\nor heights in the range of [0, 1]. These values are then scaled by 1000 and\nconverted to integers. Effectively, the coordinates represent the bounding box\non a 1000x1000 pixel version of the image. Therefore, you'll need to\nconvert these coordinates back to the dimensions of your original\nimage to accurately map the bounding boxes. IMG_PATH = /path/to/your/image1.jpeg if [[ \" $( base64 --version 2>&1 ) \" = * \"FreeBSD\" * ]] ; then B64FLAGS = \"--input\" else B64FLAGS = \"-w0\" fi curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-pro:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d \"{ \\\"contents\\\": [{ \\\"parts\\\":[ { \\\"inline_data\\\": { \\\"mime_type\\\": \\\"image/jpeg\\\", \\\"data\\\": \\\"'\\$(base64 $B64FLAGS \\\" $IMG_PATH \\\")'\\\" } }, { \\\"text\\\": \\\"Generate bounding boxes for each of the objects in this image in [y_min, x_min, y_max, x_max] format.\\\" } ] }] }\" 2 > /dev/null The model returns bounding box coordinates in the format [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] . To convert these normalized coordinates\nto the pixel coordinates of your original image, follow these steps: Divide each output coordinate by 1000. Multiply the x-coordinates by the original image width. Multiply the y-coordinates by the original image height. Prompting with video In this tutorial, you will upload a video using the File API and generate\ncontent based on those images. Note: The File API is required to upload video files, due to their size.\nHowever, the File API is only available for Python, Node.js, Go, and REST. Technical details (video) Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash support up to approximately an hour of video data. Video must be in one of the following video format MIME types: video/mp4 video/mpeg video/mov video/avi video/x-flv video/mpg video/webm video/wmv video/3gpp The File API service extracts image frames from videos at 1 frame per second\n(FPS) and audio at 1Kbps, single channel, adding timestamps every second.\nThese rates are subject to change in the future for improvements in inference. Note: The details of fast action sequences may be lost at the 1 FPS frame\nsampling rate. Consider slowing down high-speed clips for improved inference\nquality. Individual frames are 258 tokens, and audio is 32 tokens per second. With\nmetadata, each second of video becomes ~300 tokens, which means a 1M context\nwindow can fit slightly less than an hour of video. To ask questions about time-stamped locations, use the format MM:SS , where\nthe first two digits represent minutes and the last two digits represent\nseconds. For best results: Use one video per prompt. If using a single video, place the text prompt after the video.

For example, Gemini can: Describe, summarize, or answer questions about audio content. Provide a transcription of the audio. Provide answers or a transcription about a specific segment of the audio. Note: You can't generate audio output with the Gemini API. This guide demonstrates different ways to interact with audio files and audio\ncontent using the Gemini API. Supported audio formats Gemini supports the following audio format MIME types: WAV - audio/wav MP3 - audio/mp3 AIFF - audio/aiff AAC - audio/aac OGG Vorbis - audio/ogg FLAC - audio/flac Technical details about audio Gemini imposes the following rules on audio: Gemini represents each second of audio as 25 tokens; for example,\none minute of audio is represented as 1,500 tokens. Gemini can only infer responses to English-language speech. Gemini can \"understand\" non-speech components, such as birdsong or sirens. The maximum supported length of audio data in a single prompt is 9.5 hours.\nGemini doesn't limit the number of audio files in a single prompt; however,\nthe total combined length of all audio files in a single prompt cannot exceed\n9.5 hours. Gemini downsamples audio files to a 16 Kbps data resolution. If the audio source contains multiple channels, Gemini combines those channels\ndown to a single channel.

Expand to view how to set up your project and API key Tip: For complete setup instructions, see the Gemini API quickstart . Get and secure your API key You need an API key to call the Gemini API. If you don't already have one,\ncreate a key in Google AI Studio. Get an API key It's strongly recommended that you do not check an API key into your version\ncontrol system. This tutorial assumes that you're accessing your API key as an environment\nvariable. Make an audio file available to Gemini You can make an audio file available to Gemini in either of the following ways: Upload the audio file prior to making the prompt request. Provide the audio file as inline data to the prompt request. Upload an audio file and generate content You can use the File API to upload an audio file of any size. Always use the\nFile API when the total request size (including the files, text prompt, system\ninstructions, etc.) is larger than 20 MB.

PDF input For PDF payloads under 20MB, you can choose between uploading base64\nencoded documents or directly uploading locally stored files. Base64 encoded documents You can process PDF documents directly from URLs. Here's a code snippet\nshowing how to do this: DOC_URL = \"https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10089234/1/343019_3_art_0_py4t4l_convrt.pdf\" PROMPT = \"Summarize this document\" DISPLAY_NAME = \"base64_pdf\" # Download the PDF wget -O \" ${ DISPLAY_NAME } .pdf\" \" ${ DOC_URL } \" # Check for FreeBSD base64 and set flags accordingly if [[ \" $( base64 --version 2>&1 ) \" = * \"FreeBSD\" * ]] ; then B64FLAGS = \"--input\" else B64FLAGS = \"-w0\" fi # Base64 encode the PDF ENCODED_PDF = $( base64 $B64FLAGS \" ${ DISPLAY_NAME } .pdf\" ) # Generate content using the base64 encoded PDF curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [{ \"parts\":[ {\"inline_data\": {\"mime_type\": \"application/pdf\", \"data\": \"' \" $ENCODED_PDF \" '\"}}, {\"text\": \"' $PROMPT '\"} ] }] }' 2 > /dev/null > response.json\n\ncat response.json echo jq \".candidates[].content.parts[].text\" response.json # Clean up the downloaded PDF rm \" ${ DISPLAY_NAME } .pdf\" Large PDFs You can use the File API to upload a document of any size. Always use the File\nAPI when the total request size (including the files, text prompt, system\ninstructions, etc.) is larger than 20 MB. Note: The File API lets you store up to 20 GB of files per project, with a\nper-file maximum size of 2 GB. Files are stored for 48 hours. They can be\naccessed in that period with your API key, but cannot be downloaded from the\nAPI. The File API is available at no cost in all regions where the Gemini API is\navailable. Call media.upload to upload a file using the\nFile API. The following code uploads a document file and then uses the file in a\ncall to models.generateContent . Large PDFs from URLs Use the File API for large PDF files available from URLs,\nsimplifying the process of uploading and processing these documents directly\nthrough their URLs: PDF_PATH = \"https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/static/history/alsj/a17/A17_FlightPlan.pdf\" DISPLAY_NAME = \"A17_FlightPlan\" PROMPT = \"Summarize this document\" # Download the PDF from the provided URL wget -O \" ${ DISPLAY_NAME } .pdf\" \" ${ PDF_PATH } \" MIME_TYPE = $( file -b --mime-type \" ${ DISPLAY_NAME } .pdf\" ) NUM_BYTES = $( wc -c < \" ${ DISPLAY_NAME } .pdf\" ) echo \"MIME_TYPE: ${ MIME_TYPE } \" echo \"NUM_BYTES: ${ NUM_BYTES } \" tmp_header_file = upload-header.tmp # Initial resumable request defining metadata. # The upload url is in the response headers dump them to a file. curl \" ${ BASE_URL } /upload/v1beta/files?key= ${ GOOGLE_API_KEY } \" \\ -D upload-header.tmp \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Protocol: resumable\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Command: start\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Length: ${ NUM_BYTES } \" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Type: ${ MIME_TYPE } \" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"{'file': {'display_name': ' ${ DISPLAY_NAME } '}}\" 2 > /dev/null upload_url = $( grep -i \"x-goog-upload-url: \" \" ${ tmp_header_file } \" | cut -d \" \" -f2 | tr -d \"\\r\" ) rm \" ${ tmp_header_file } \" # Upload the actual bytes. curl \" ${ upload_url } \" \\ -H \"Content-Length: ${ NUM_BYTES } \" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Offset: 0\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Command: upload, finalize\" \\ --data-binary \"@ ${ DISPLAY_NAME } .pdf\" 2 > /dev/null > file_info.json file_uri = $( jq \".file.uri\" file_info.json ) echo \"file_uri: ${ file_uri } \" # Now generate content using that file curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [{ \"parts\":[ {\"text\": \"' $PROMPT '\"}, {\"file_data\":{\"mime_type\": \"application/pdf\", \"file_uri\": ' $file_uri '}}] }] }' 2 > /dev/null > response.json\n\ncat response.json echo jq \".candidates[].content.parts[].text\" response.json # Clean up the downloaded PDF rm \" ${ DISPLAY_NAME } .pdf\" Large PDFs stored locally NUM_BYTES = $( wc -c < \" ${ PDF_PATH } \" ) DISPLAY_NAME = TEXT tmp_header_file = upload-header.tmp # Initial resumable request defining metadata. # The upload url is in the response headers dump them to a file. curl \" ${ BASE_URL } /upload/v1beta/files?key= ${ GOOGLE_API_KEY } \" \\ -D upload-header.tmp \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Protocol: resumable\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Command: start\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Length: ${ NUM_BYTES } \" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Type: application/pdf\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"{'file': {'display_name': ' ${ DISPLAY_NAME } '}}\" 2 > /dev/null upload_url = $( grep -i \"x-goog-upload-url: \" \" ${ tmp_header_file } \" | cut -d \" \" -f2 | tr -d \"\\r\" ) rm \" ${ tmp_header_file } \" # Upload the actual bytes. curl \" ${ upload_url } \" \\ -H \"Content-Length: ${ NUM_BYTES } \" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Offset: 0\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Command: upload, finalize\" \\ --data-binary \"@ ${ PDF_PATH } \" 2 > /dev/null > file_info.json file_uri = $( jq \".file.uri\" file_info.json ) echo file_uri = $file_uri # Now generate content using that file curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [{ \"parts\":[ {\"text\": \"Can you add a few more lines to this poem?\"}, {\"file_data\":{\"mime_type\": \"application/pdf\", \"file_uri\": ' $file_uri '}}] }] }' 2 > /dev/null > response.json\n\ncat response.json echo jq \".candidates[].content.parts[].text\" response.json files.sh You can verify the API successfully stored the uploaded file and get its\nmetadata by calling files.get .

Learn more Home Gemini API Models Send feedback Grounding with Google Search Important: We're launching Grounding with Google Search! Review the updated Gemini API Additional Terms of Service ,\nwhich include new feature terms and updates for clarity. Python Node.js REST The Grounding with Google Search feature in the Gemini API and AI Studio can be\nused to improve the accuracy and recency of responses from the model. In\naddition to more factual responses, when Grounding with Google Search is\nenabled, the Gemini API returns grounding sources (in-line supporting links) and Google Search Suggestions along with the response\ncontent. The Search Suggestions point users to the search results corresponding\nto the grounded response. Grounding with Google Search only supports text prompts. It doesn't support\nmultimodal (text-and-image, text-and-audio, etc.) prompts. Grounding with\nGoogle Search supports all of the available languages for\nGemini models. This guide will help you get started with Grounding with Google Search using one\nof the Gemini API SDKs or the REST API. Configure a model to use Google Search Tip: Before running the example code, make sure that you've followed the\ninstallation and setup instructions in the quickstart . The following example shows to configure a model to use Grounding with Google\nSearch: echo '{\"contents\": [{\"parts\": [{\"text\": \"What is the current Google stock price?\"}]}], \"tools\": [{\"google_search_retrieval\": { \"dynamic_retrieval_config\": { \"mode\": \"MODE_DYNAMIC\", \"dynamic_threshold\": 1, } } } ] }' > request.json\n\ncurl -X POST \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-pro-002:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d @request.json > response.json\n\ncat response.json The mode and dynamic_threshold settings let you control the behavior of dynamic retrieval , giving you additional control over when\nto use Grounding with Google Search. Why is Grounding with Google Search useful? In generative AI, grounding refers to the process of connecting the model to\nverifiable sources of information. These sources might provide real-world\nworkplace information or other specific context. Grounding helps with improving\nthe accuracy, reliability, and usefulness of AI outputs. Grounding is particularly important for prompts that require up-to-date\ninformation from the web. Using grounding, the model can access information\nbeyond its knowledge cutoff date, get sources for the information, and answer\nquestions that it couldn't have answered accurately otherwise. Using Google AI Studio or the Gemini API, you can ground model output to\nGoogle Search. Grounding with Google Search provides the following benefits: Allows model responses that are tethered to specific content. Reduces model hallucinations, which are instances where the model generates\ncontent that isn't factual. Anchors model responses to sources a user can click through and open. Enhances the trustworthiness and applicability of the generated content. When you use Grounding with Google Search, you're effectively connecting the\nmodel to reliable Search results from the internet. Since non-grounded model\nresponses are based on learned patterns, you might not get factual responses to\nprompts about current events (for example, asking for a weather forecast or the\nfinal score of a recent football game). Since the internet provides access to\nnew information, a grounded prompt can generate more up-to-date responses, with\nsources cited. Here's an example comparing a non-grounded response and a grounded response\ngenerated using the API. (The responses were generated in October 2024.) Ungrounded Gemini Grounding with Google Search Prompt: Who won the Super Bowl this year? Response: The Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl\n        LVII this year (2023). Prompt: Who won the Super Bowl this year? Response: The Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl\n        LVIII this year, defeating the San Francisco 49ers in overtime with a\n        score of 25 to 22. In the ungrounded response, the model refers to the Kansas City Chiefs' 2023\nSuper Bowl win. In the grounded response, the model correctly references their\nmore recent 2024 win. The following image shows how a grounded response looks in AI Studio. Google Search Suggestions To use Grounding with Google Search, you have to display Google Search\nSuggestions, which are suggested queries included in the metadata of the\ngrounded response. To learn more about the display requirements, see Use Google Search Suggestions . Dynamic retrieval Some queries are likely to benefit more from Grounding with Google Search than\nothers. The dynamic retrieval feature gives you additional control over when\nto use Grounding with Google Search. If the dynamic retrieval mode is unspecified, Grounding with Google Search is\nalways triggered. If the mode is set to dynamic, the model decides when to use\ngrounding based on a threshold that you can configure. The threshold\nis a floating-point value in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.3. If the\nthreshold value is 0, the response is always grounded with Google Search; if\nit's 1, it never is. How dynamic retrieval works You can use dynamic retrieval in your request to choose when to turn on\nGrounding with Google Search. This is useful when the prompt doesn't require\nan answer grounded in Google Search and the model can provide an answer based\non its own knowledge without grounding. This helps you manage latency, quality,\nand cost more effectively. Before you invoke the dynamic retrieval configuration in your request,\nunderstand the following terminology: Prediction score : When you request a grounded answer, Gemini assigns a prediction score to the prompt. The prediction score is a floating point\nvalue in the range [0,1]. Its value depends on whether the prompt\ncan benefit from grounding the answer with the most up-to-date\ninformation from Google Search. Thus, if a prompt requires an answer\ngrounded in the most recent facts on the web, it has a higher prediction\nscore. A prompt for which a model-generated answer is sufficient has a lower\nprediction score. Here are examples of some prompts and their prediction scores. Note: The prediction scores are assigned by Gemini and can vary over\ntime depending on several factors. Prompt Prediction score Comment \"Write a poem about peonies\" 0.13 The model can rely on its knowledge and the answer doesn't need grounding. \"Suggest a toy for a 2yo child\" 0.36 The model can rely on its knowledge and the answer doesn't need grounding. \"Can you give a recipe for an asian-inspired guacamole?\" 0.55 Google Search can give a grounded answer, but grounding isn't strictly required; the model knowledge might be sufficient. \"What's Agent Builder? How is grounding billed in Agent Builder?\" 0.72 Requires Google Search to generate a well-grounded answer. \"Who won the latest F1 grand prix?\" 0.97 Requires Google Search to generate a well-grounded answer. Threshold : In your API request, you can specify a dynamic retrieval\nconfiguration with a threshold. The threshold is a floating point value in\nthe range [0,1] and defaults to 0.3. If the threshold value is zero, the\nresponse is always grounded with Google Search. For all other values\nof threshold, the following is applicable: If the prediction score is greater than or equal to the threshold, the\nanswer is grounded with Google Search.\nA lower threshold implies that more prompts have responses that are\ngenerated using Grounding with Google Search. If the prediction score is less than the threshold, the model might still\ngenerate the answer, but it isn't grounded with Google Search. To learn how to set the dynamic retrieval threshold using an SDK or the REST\nAPI, see the appropriate code example . If you're using AI Studio, you can set the dynamic retrieval threshold by\nclicking Edit grounding . To find a good threshold that suits your business needs, you can create a\nrepresentative set of queries that you expect to encounter. Then you can sort\nthe queries according to the prediction score in the response and select a\ngood threshold for your use case. A grounded response If your prompt successfully grounds to Google Search, the response will include groundingMetadata . A grounded response might look something like this\n(parts of the response have been omitted for brevity): { \"candidates\" : [ { \"content\" : { \"parts\" : [ { \"text\" : \"Carlos Alcaraz won the Gentlemen's Singles title at the 2024 Wimbledon Championships.

Learn more Home Gemini API Models Send feedback Grounding with Google Search Important: We're launching Grounding with Google Search! Review the updated Gemini API Additional Terms of Service ,\nwhich include new feature terms and updates for clarity. Python Node.js REST The Grounding with Google Search feature in the Gemini API and AI Studio can be\nused to improve the accuracy and recency of responses from the model. In\naddition to more factual responses, when Grounding with Google Search is\nenabled, the Gemini API returns grounding sources (in-line supporting links) and Google Search Suggestions along with the response\ncontent. The Search Suggestions point users to the search results corresponding\nto the grounded response. Grounding with Google Search only supports text prompts. It doesn't support\nmultimodal (text-and-image, text-and-audio, etc.) prompts. Grounding with\nGoogle Search supports all of the available languages for\nGemini models. This guide will help you get started with Grounding with Google Search using one\nof the Gemini API SDKs or the REST API. Configure a model to use Google Search Tip: Before running the example code, make sure that you've followed the\ninstallation and setup instructions in the quickstart . Why is Grounding with Google Search useful? In generative AI, grounding refers to the process of connecting the model to\nverifiable sources of information. These sources might provide real-world\nworkplace information or other specific context. Grounding helps with improving\nthe accuracy, reliability, and usefulness of AI outputs. Grounding is particularly important for prompts that require up-to-date\ninformation from the web. Using grounding, the model can access information\nbeyond its knowledge cutoff date, get sources for the information, and answer\nquestions that it couldn't have answered accurately otherwise. Using Google AI Studio or the Gemini API, you can ground model output to\nGoogle Search. Grounding with Google Search provides the following benefits: Allows model responses that are tethered to specific content. Reduces model hallucinations, which are instances where the model generates\ncontent that isn't factual. Anchors model responses to sources a user can click through and open. Enhances the trustworthiness and applicability of the generated content. When you use Grounding with Google Search, you're effectively connecting the\nmodel to reliable Search results from the internet. Since non-grounded model\nresponses are based on learned patterns, you might not get factual responses to\nprompts about current events (for example, asking for a weather forecast or the\nfinal score of a recent football game). Since the internet provides access to\nnew information, a grounded prompt can generate more up-to-date responses, with\nsources cited. Here's an example comparing a non-grounded response and a grounded response\ngenerated using the API. (The responses were generated in October 2024.) Ungrounded Gemini Grounding with Google Search Prompt: Who won the Super Bowl this year? Response: The Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl\n        LVII this year (2023). Prompt: Who won the Super Bowl this year? Response: The Kansas City Chiefs won Super Bowl\n        LVIII this year, defeating the San Francisco 49ers in overtime with a\n        score of 25 to 22. In the ungrounded response, the model refers to the Kansas City Chiefs' 2023\nSuper Bowl win. In the grounded response, the model correctly references their\nmore recent 2024 win. The following image shows how a grounded response looks in AI Studio. Google Search Suggestions To use Grounding with Google Search, you have to display Google Search\nSuggestions, which are suggested queries included in the metadata of the\ngrounded response. To learn more about the display requirements, see Use Google Search Suggestions . Dynamic retrieval Some queries are likely to benefit more from Grounding with Google Search than\nothers. The dynamic retrieval feature gives you additional control over when\nto use Grounding with Google Search. If the dynamic retrieval mode is unspecified, Grounding with Google Search is\nalways triggered. If the mode is set to dynamic, the model decides when to use\ngrounding based on a threshold that you can configure. The threshold\nis a floating-point value in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.3. If the\nthreshold value is 0, the response is always grounded with Google Search; if\nit's 1, it never is. How dynamic retrieval works You can use dynamic retrieval in your request to choose when to turn on\nGrounding with Google Search. This is useful when the prompt doesn't require\nan answer grounded in Google Search and the model can provide an answer based\non its own knowledge without grounding. This helps you manage latency, quality,\nand cost more effectively. Before you invoke the dynamic retrieval configuration in your request,\nunderstand the following terminology: Prediction score : When you request a grounded answer, Gemini assigns a prediction score to the prompt. The prediction score is a floating point\nvalue in the range [0,1]. Its value depends on whether the prompt\ncan benefit from grounding the answer with the most up-to-date\ninformation from Google Search. Thus, if a prompt requires an answer\ngrounded in the most recent facts on the web, it has a higher prediction\nscore. A prompt for which a model-generated answer is sufficient has a lower\nprediction score. Here are examples of some prompts and their prediction scores. Note: The prediction scores are assigned by Gemini and can vary over\ntime depending on several factors. Prompt Prediction score Comment \"Write a poem about peonies\" 0.13 The model can rely on its knowledge and the answer doesn't need grounding. \"Suggest a toy for a 2yo child\" 0.36 The model can rely on its knowledge and the answer doesn't need grounding. \"Can you give a recipe for an asian-inspired guacamole?\" 0.55 Google Search can give a grounded answer, but grounding isn't strictly required; the model knowledge might be sufficient. \"What's Agent Builder? How is grounding billed in Agent Builder?\" 0.72 Requires Google Search to generate a well-grounded answer. \"Who won the latest F1 grand prix?\" 0.97 Requires Google Search to generate a well-grounded answer. Threshold : In your API request, you can specify a dynamic retrieval\nconfiguration with a threshold. The threshold is a floating point value in\nthe range [0,1] and defaults to 0.3. If the threshold value is zero, the\nresponse is always grounded with Google Search. For all other values\nof threshold, the following is applicable: If the prediction score is greater than or equal to the threshold, the\nanswer is grounded with Google Search.\nA lower threshold implies that more prompts have responses that are\ngenerated using Grounding with Google Search. If the prediction score is less than the threshold, the model might still\ngenerate the answer, but it isn't grounded with Google Search. To learn how to set the dynamic retrieval threshold using an SDK or the REST\nAPI, see the appropriate code example . If you're using AI Studio, you can set the dynamic retrieval threshold by\nclicking Edit grounding . To find a good threshold that suits your business needs, you can create a\nrepresentative set of queries that you expect to encounter. Then you can sort\nthe queries according to the prediction score in the response and select a\ngood threshold for your use case. A grounded response If your prompt successfully grounds to Google Search, the response will include groundingMetadata . A grounded response might look something like this\n(parts of the response have been omitted for brevity): { \"candidates\" : [ { \"content\" : { \"parts\" : [ { \"text\" : \"Carlos Alcaraz won the Gentlemen's Singles title at the 2024 Wimbledon Championships.

Learn more Home Gemini API Models Send feedback Context caching Python Node.js Go REST In a typical AI workflow, you might pass the same input tokens over and over to\na model. Using the Gemini API context caching feature, you can pass some content\nto the model once, cache the input tokens, and then refer to the cached tokens\nfor subsequent requests. At certain volumes, using cached tokens is lower cost\nthan passing in the same corpus of tokens repeatedly. When you cache a set of tokens, you can choose how long you want the cache to\nexist before the tokens are automatically deleted. This caching duration is\ncalled the time to live (TTL). If not set, the TTL defaults to 1 hour. The\ncost for caching depends on the input token size and how long you want the\ntokens to persist. Context caching supports both Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Note: Context caching is only available for stable models with fixed versions\n(for example, gemini-1.5-pro-001 ). You must include the version postfix (for\nexample, the -001 in gemini-1.5-pro-001 ). When to use context caching Context caching is particularly well suited to scenarios where a substantial\ninitial context is referenced repeatedly by shorter requests. Consider using\ncontext caching for use cases such as: Chatbots with extensive system instructions Repetitive analysis of lengthy video files Recurring queries against large document sets Frequent code repository analysis or bug fixing How caching reduces costs Context caching is a paid feature designed to reduce overall operational costs.\nBilling is based on the following factors: Cache token count: The number of input tokens cached, billed at a\nreduced rate when included in subsequent prompts. Storage duration: The amount of time cached tokens are stored (TTL),\nbilled based on the TTL duration of cached token count. There are no minimum\nor maximum bounds on the TTL. Other factors: Other charges apply, such as for non-cached input tokens\nand output tokens. For up-to-date pricing details, refer to the Gemini API pricing\npage . To learn how to count tokens, see the Token\nguide . How to use context caching This section assumes that you've installed a Gemini SDK (or have curl installed)\nand that you've configured an API key, as shown in the quickstart . Generate content using a cache The following example shows how to create a cache and then use it to generate\ncontent. wget https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/a11.txt echo '{ \"model\": \"models/gemini-1.5-flash-001\", \"contents\":[ { \"parts\":[ { \"inline_data\": { \"mime_type\":\"text/plain\", \"data\": \"' $( base64 $B64FLAGS a11.txt ) '\" } } ], \"role\": \"user\" } ], \"systemInstruction\": { \"parts\": [ { \"text\": \"You are an expert at analyzing transcripts.\" } ] }, \"ttl\": \"300s\" }' > request.json\n\ncurl -X POST \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/cachedContents?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d @request.json \\ > cache.json CACHE_NAME = $( cat cache.json | grep '\"name\":' | cut -d '\"' -f 4 | head -n 1 ) curl -X POST \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-001:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [ { \"parts\":[{ \"text\": \"Please summarize this transcript\" }], \"role\": \"user\" }, ], \"cachedContent\": \"' $CACHE_NAME '\" }' cache.sh List caches It's not possible to retrieve or view cached content, but you can retrieve\ncache metadata ( name , model , displayName , usageMetadata , createTime , updateTime , and expireTime ). curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/cachedContents?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" cache.sh Update a cache You can set a new ttl or expireTime for a cache. Changing anything else\nabout the cache isn't supported. The following example shows how to update the ttl of a cache. curl -X PATCH \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/ $CACHE_NAME ?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d '{\"ttl\": \"600s\"}' cache.sh Delete a cache The caching service provides a delete operation for manually removing content\nfrom the cache. The following example shows how to delete a cache. curl -X DELETE \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/ $CACHE_NAME ?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" cache.sh Additional considerations Keep the following considerations in mind when using context caching: The minimum input token count for context caching is 32,768, and the maximum is the same as the maximum for the given model. (For more on\ncounting tokens, see the Token guide ). The model doesn't make any distinction between cached tokens and regular\ninput tokens. Cached content is simply a prefix to the prompt. There are no special rate or usage limits on context caching; the standard\nrate limits for GenerateContent apply, and token limits include cached\ntokens. The number of cached tokens is returned in the usage_metadata from the\ncreate, get, and list operations of the cache service, and also in GenerateContent when using the cache.

Learn more Home Gemini API Models Send feedback Context caching Python Node.js Go REST In a typical AI workflow, you might pass the same input tokens over and over to\na model. Using the Gemini API context caching feature, you can pass some content\nto the model once, cache the input tokens, and then refer to the cached tokens\nfor subsequent requests. At certain volumes, using cached tokens is lower cost\nthan passing in the same corpus of tokens repeatedly. When you cache a set of tokens, you can choose how long you want the cache to\nexist before the tokens are automatically deleted. This caching duration is\ncalled the time to live (TTL). If not set, the TTL defaults to 1 hour. The\ncost for caching depends on the input token size and how long you want the\ntokens to persist. Context caching supports both Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Note: Context caching is only available for stable models with fixed versions\n(for example, gemini-1.5-pro-001 ). You must include the version postfix (for\nexample, the -001 in gemini-1.5-pro-001 ). When to use context caching Context caching is particularly well suited to scenarios where a substantial\ninitial context is referenced repeatedly by shorter requests. Consider using\ncontext caching for use cases such as: Chatbots with extensive system instructions Repetitive analysis of lengthy video files Recurring queries against large document sets Frequent code repository analysis or bug fixing How caching reduces costs Context caching is a paid feature designed to reduce overall operational costs.\nBilling is based on the following factors: Cache token count: The number of input tokens cached, billed at a\nreduced rate when included in subsequent prompts. Storage duration: The amount of time cached tokens are stored (TTL),\nbilled based on the TTL duration of cached token count. There are no minimum\nor maximum bounds on the TTL. Other factors: Other charges apply, such as for non-cached input tokens\nand output tokens. For up-to-date pricing details, refer to the Gemini API pricing\npage . To learn how to count tokens, see the Token\nguide . How to use context caching This section assumes that you've installed a Gemini SDK (or have curl installed)\nand that you've configured an API key, as shown in the quickstart . Additional considerations Keep the following considerations in mind when using context caching: The minimum input token count for context caching is 32,768, and the maximum is the same as the maximum for the given model. (For more on\ncounting tokens, see the Token guide ). The model doesn't make any distinction between cached tokens and regular\ninput tokens. Cached content is simply a prefix to the prompt. There are no special rate or usage limits on context caching; the standard\nrate limits for GenerateContent apply, and token limits include cached\ntokens. The number of cached tokens is returned in the usage_metadata from the\ncreate, get, and list operations of the cache service, and also in GenerateContent when using the cache.

Learn more Home Gemini API Models Send feedback Safety settings The Gemini API provides safety settings that you can adjust during the\nprototyping stage to determine if your application requires more or less\nrestrictive safety configuration. You can adjust these settings across four\nfilter categories to restrict or allow certain types of content. This guide covers how the Gemini API handles safety settings and filtering and\nhow you can change the safety settings for your application. Note: Applications that use less restrictive safety settings may be subject to\nreview. See the Terms of Service for more information. Safety filters The Gemini API's adjustable safety filters cover the following categories: Category Description Harassment Negative or harmful comments targeting identity and/or protected\n      attributes. Hate speech Content that is rude, disrespectful, or profane. Sexually explicit Contains references to sexual acts or other lewd content. Dangerous Promotes, facilitates, or encourages harmful acts. Civic integrity Election-related queries. These categories are defined in HarmCategory . The\n  Gemini models only support HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT , HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH , HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT , HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT , and HARM_CATEGORY_CIVIC_INTEGRITY . All other categories are used\n  only by PaLM 2 (Legacy) models. You can use these filters to adjust what's appropriate for your use case. For\nexample, if you're building video game dialogue, you may deem it acceptable to\nallow more content that's rated as Dangerous due to the nature of the game. In addition to the adjustable safety filters, the Gemini API has built-in\nprotections against core harms, such as content that endangers child safety.\nThese types of harm are always blocked and cannot be adjusted. Content safety filtering level The Gemini API categorizes the probability level of content being unsafe as HIGH , MEDIUM , LOW , or NEGLIGIBLE . The Gemini API blocks content based on the probability of content being unsafe\nand not the severity. This is important to consider because some content can\nhave low probability of being unsafe even though the severity of harm could\nstill be high. For example, comparing the sentences: The robot punched me. The robot slashed me up. The first sentence might result in a higher probability of being unsafe, but you\nmight consider the second sentence to be a higher severity in terms of violence.\nGiven this, it is important that you carefully test and consider what the\nappropriate level of blocking is needed to support your key use cases while\nminimizing harm to end users. Safety filtering per request You can adjust the safety settings for each request you make to the API. When\nyou make a request, the content is analyzed and assigned a safety rating. The\nsafety rating includes the category and the probability of the harm\nclassification. For example, if the content was blocked due to the harassment\ncategory having a high probability, the safety rating returned would have\ncategory equal to HARASSMENT and harm probability set to HIGH . By default, safety settings block content (including prompts) with medium or\nhigher probability of being unsafe across any filter. This baseline safety is\ndesigned to work for most use cases, so you should only adjust your safety\nsettings if it's consistently required for your application. The following table describes the block settings you can adjust for each\ncategory. For example, if you set the block setting to Block few for the Hate speech category, everything that has a high probability of being hate\nspeech content is blocked. But anything with a lower probability is allowed. Threshold (Google AI Studio) Threshold (API) Description Block none BLOCK_NONE Always show regardless of probability of unsafe content Block few BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH Block when high probability of unsafe content Block some BLOCK_MEDIUM_AND_ABOVE Block when medium or high probability of unsafe content Block most BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE Block when low, medium or high probability of unsafe content N/A HARM_BLOCK_THRESHOLD_UNSPECIFIED Threshold is unspecified, block using default threshold If the threshold is not set, the default block threshold is Block most (for gemini-1.5-pro-002 and gemini-1.5-flash-002 only) or Block some (in all\nother models) for all categories except the Civic integrity category. The default block threshold for the Civic integrity category is Block most when sending prompts using Google AI Studio, and Block none when using the\nGemini API directly. You can set these settings for each request you make to the generative service.\nSee the HarmBlockThreshold API\nreference for details. Safety feedback generateContent returns a GenerateContentResponse which\nincludes safety feedback. Prompt feedback is included in promptFeedback . If promptFeedback.blockReason is set, then the content of the prompt was blocked. Response candidate feedback is included in Candidate.finishReason and Candidate.safetyRatings . If response\ncontent was blocked and the finishReason was SAFETY , you can inspect safetyRatings for more details. The content that was blocked is not returned. Adjust safety settings This section covers how to adjust the safety settings in both Google AI Studio\nand in your code. Google AI Studio You can adjust safety settings in Google AI Studio, but you cannot turn them\noff. Click Edit safety settings in the Run settings panel to open the Run\nsafety settings modal. In the modal, you can use the sliders to adjust the\ncontent filtering level per safety category: Note: If you set any of the category filters to Block none , Google AI Studio\nwill display a reminder about the Gemini API's Terms of Service with respect\nto safety settings. When you send a request (for example, by asking the model a question), a warning No Content message appears if the request's content is blocked. To see more\ndetails, hold the pointer over the No Content text and click warning Safety . Gemini API SDKs The following code snippet shows how to set safety settings in your GenerateContent call. This sets the thresholds for the harassment\n( HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT ) and hate speech ( HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH )\ncategories.

Learn more Home Gemini API Models Send feedback Use system instructions to steer the behavior of a model Python Node.js REST Go System instructions let you steer the behavior of a model based on\nyour specific needs and use cases. When you set a system instruction, you give\nthe model additional context to understand the task, provide more customized\nresponses, and adhere to specific guidelines over the full user interaction with\nthe model. You can also specify product-level behavior by setting system\ninstructions, separate from prompts provided by end users. Basic example Here's a basic example of how to set the system instruction using the SDKs for\nthe Gemini API: curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key=$GOOGLE_API_KEY \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n-d '{ \"system_instruction\": {\n    \"parts\":\n      { \"text\": \"You are Neko the cat respond like one\"}},\n    \"contents\": {\n      \"parts\": {\n        \"text\": \"Good morning! How are you?\"}}}' This example might give a response such as: *Yawns widely, stretching out my claws and batting at a sunbeam*\nMeow. I'm doing quite well, thanks for asking. It's a good morning for napping.\nPerhaps you could fetch my favorite feathered toy?  *Looks expectantly* Try it in a colab For an interactive end to end example of using system instructions, see the Gemini API: System instructions colab. Note: System instructions can help guide the model to follow instructions, but\nthey don't fully prevent jailbreaks or leaks. We recommend exercising caution\naround putting any sensitive information in system instructions. More examples You can use system instructions in many ways, including: Defining a persona or role (for a chatbot, for example) Defining output format (Markdown, YAML, etc.) Defining output style and tone (for example, verbosity, formality, and target\nreading level) Defining goals or rules for the task (for example, returning a code snippet\nwithout further explanations) Providing additional context for the prompt (for example, a knowledge cutoff) System instructions are part of your overall prompts and therefore are subject\nto standard data use policies. Here are some examples of system instructions and user prompts: Code generation System instruction: You are a coding expert that specializes in rendering\ncode for frontend interfaces. When I describe a component of a website I want\nto build, return the HTML and CSS needed to do so. Don't give an\nexplanation for this code. Also offer some UI design suggestions. User prompt: Create a box in the middle of the page that contains a rotating selection of\nimages each with a caption. The image in the center of the page should have\nshadowing behind it to make it stand out. It should also link to another page\nof the site. Leave the URL blank so that I can fill it in. Formatted data generation System instruction: You are an assistant for home cooks. You receive a list\nof ingredients and respond with a list of recipes that use those ingredients.\nRecipes which need no extra ingredients should always be listed before those\nthat do. Your response must be a JSON object containing 3 recipes. A recipe object has\nthe following schema: name: The name of the recipe usedIngredients: Ingredients in the recipe that were provided in the list otherIngredients: Ingredients in the recipe that were not provided in the\nlist (omitted if there are no other ingredients) description: A brief description of the recipe, written positively as if\nto sell it User prompt: bag of frozen broccoli, pint of heavy cream, pack of cheese\nends and pieces Music chatbot System instruction: You will respond as a music historian, demonstrating\ncomprehensive knowledge across diverse musical genres and providing relevant\nexamples. Your tone will be upbeat and enthusiastic, spreading the joy of\nmusic. If a question is not related to music, the response should be,\n\"That is beyond my knowledge.\" User prompt: If a person was born in the sixties, what was the most popular music genre\nbeing played? List five songs by bullet point.
