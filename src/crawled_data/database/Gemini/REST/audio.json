Learn more Home Gemini API Models Send feedback Explore audio capabilities with the Gemini API Python Node.js Go REST Gemini can respond to prompts about audio. For example, Gemini can: Describe, summarize, or answer questions about audio content. Provide a transcription of the audio. Provide answers or a transcription about a specific segment of the audio. Note: You can't generate audio output with the Gemini API. This guide demonstrates different ways to interact with audio files and audio\ncontent using the Gemini API. Supported audio formats Gemini supports the following audio format MIME types: WAV - audio/wav MP3 - audio/mp3 AIFF - audio/aiff AAC - audio/aac OGG Vorbis - audio/ogg FLAC - audio/flac Technical details about audio Gemini imposes the following rules on audio: Gemini represents each second of audio as 25 tokens; for example,\none minute of audio is represented as 1,500 tokens. Gemini can only infer responses to English-language speech. Gemini can \"understand\" non-speech components, such as birdsong or sirens. The maximum supported length of audio data in a single prompt is 9.5 hours.\nGemini doesn't limit the number of audio files in a single prompt; however,\nthe total combined length of all audio files in a single prompt cannot exceed\n9.5 hours. Gemini downsamples audio files to a 16 Kbps data resolution. If the audio source contains multiple channels, Gemini combines those channels\ndown to a single channel. Before you begin: Set up your project and API key Before calling the Gemini API, you need to set up your project and configure\nyour API key. Expand to view how to set up your project and API key Tip: For complete setup instructions, see the Gemini API quickstart . Get and secure your API key You need an API key to call the Gemini API. If you don't already have one,\ncreate a key in Google AI Studio. Get an API key It's strongly recommended that you do not check an API key into your version\ncontrol system. This tutorial assumes that you're accessing your API key as an environment\nvariable. Make an audio file available to Gemini You can make an audio file available to Gemini in either of the following ways: Upload the audio file prior to making the prompt request. Provide the audio file as inline data to the prompt request. Upload an audio file and generate content You can use the File API to upload an audio file of any size. Always use the\nFile API when the total request size (including the files, text prompt, system\ninstructions, etc.) is larger than 20 MB. Note: The File API lets you store up to 20 GB of files per project, with a\nper-file maximum size of 2 GB. Files are stored for 48 hours. They can be\naccessed in that period with your API key, but cannot be downloaded from the\nAPI. The File API is available at no cost in all regions where the Gemini API is\navailable. Call media.upload to upload a file using the\nFile API. The following code uploads an audio file and then uses the file in a\ncall to models.generateContent . MIME_TYPE = $( file -b --mime-type \" ${ AUDIO_PATH } \" ) NUM_BYTES = $( wc -c < \" ${ AUDIO_PATH } \" ) DISPLAY_NAME = AUDIO tmp_header_file = upload-header.tmp # Initial resumable request defining metadata. # The upload url is in the response headers dump them to a file. curl \" ${ BASE_URL } /upload/v1beta/files?key= ${ GOOGLE_API_KEY } \" \\ -D upload-header.tmp \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Protocol: resumable\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Command: start\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Length: ${ NUM_BYTES } \" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Type: ${ MIME_TYPE } \" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \"{'file': {'display_name': ' ${ DISPLAY_NAME } '}}\" 2 > /dev/null upload_url = $( grep -i \"x-goog-upload-url: \" \" ${ tmp_header_file } \" | cut -d \" \" -f2 | tr -d \"\\r\" ) rm \" ${ tmp_header_file } \" # Upload the actual bytes. curl \" ${ upload_url } \" \\ -H \"Content-Length: ${ NUM_BYTES } \" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Offset: 0\" \\ -H \"X-Goog-Upload-Command: upload, finalize\" \\ --data-binary \"@ ${ AUDIO_PATH } \" 2 > /dev/null > file_info.json file_uri = $( jq \".file.uri\" file_info.json ) echo file_uri = $file_uri # Now generate content using that file curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -X POST \\ -d '{ \"contents\": [{ \"parts\":[ {\"text\": \"Describe this audio clip\"}, {\"file_data\":{\"mime_type\": \"audio/mp3\", \"file_uri\": ' $file_uri '}}] }] }' 2 > /dev/null > response.json\n\ncat response.json echo jq \".candidates[].content.parts[].text\" response.json files.sh Get metadata for a file You can verify the API successfully stored the uploaded file and get its\nmetadata by calling files.get . name = $( jq \".file.name\" file_info.json ) # Get the file of interest to check state curl https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files/ $name > file_info.json # Print some information about the file you got name = $( jq \".file.name\" file_info.json ) echo name = $name file_uri = $( jq \".file.uri\" file_info.json ) echo file_uri = $file_uri files .sh List uploaded files You can upload multiple audio files (and other kinds of files).\nThe following code generates a list of all the files uploaded: echo \"My files: \" curl \"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files?key= $GOOGLE_API_KEY \" files.sh Delete uploaded files Files are automatically deleted after 48 hours. Optionally, you can manually\ndelete an uploaded file. For example: curl --request \"DELETE\" https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/files/ $name ?key = $GOOGLE_API_KEY files .sh What's next This guide shows how to upload audio files using the File API and then generate\ntext outputs from audio inputs.

System instructions : System\ninstructions let you steer the behavior of the model based on your specific\nneeds and use cases. Safety guidance : Sometimes generative AI\nmodels produce unexpected outputs, such as outputs that are inaccurate,\nbiased, or offensive. Post-processing and human evaluation are essential to\nlimit the risk of harm from such outputs.
