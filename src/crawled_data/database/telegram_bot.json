All Mini Apps you build on Telegram can be highly customized to fit your brand identity, including by uploading high-quality media demos and setting a custom Loading Screen with your own logo and color palette How Do Bots Work? For a detailed explanation of Bot Features, see this guide Telegram bots are special accounts that do not need a phone number to set up. Bots are connected to their owner’s server, which processes inputs and requests from users. Telegram’s intermediary server handles all encryption and communication with the Telegram API. Developers communicate with this server via an easy HTTPS-interface with a simplified version of the Telegram API – known as the Bot API . How Are Bots Different from Users? Bots are able to process inputs and requests in ways that user accounts can’t, but there are several differences between a bot and a normal user. Bots don’t have ‘last seen’ or online statuses – instead they show a ‘bot’ label in the chat. Bots have limited cloud storage – older messages may be removed by the server shortly after they have been processed. Bots can't start conversations with users. A user must either add them to a group or send them a message first. People can search for your bot’s username or start a chat via its unique t.me/bot_username link. By default, bots added to groups only see relevant messages in the chat (see Privacy Mode ). Bots never eat, sleep or complain (unless expressly programmed otherwise). Bot Links Bot usernames normally require a ‘bot’ suffix, but some bots don’t have them – such as @stickers , @gif , @wiki or @bing . Anyone can assign collectible usernames to bots, including those without the 'bot' suffix. How Do I Create a Bot? Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming . Creating a bot is streamlined by Telegram’s Bot API, which gives the tools and framework required to integrate your code. To get started, message @BotFather on Telegram to register your bot and receive its authentication token. Your bot token is its unique identifier – store it in a secure place , and only share it with people who need direct access to the bot. Everyone who has your token will have full control over your bot. What Next? We recommend that you check out our guide to Bot Features to see what you can teach your bot to do: Detailed Guide to Bot Features Full API Reference for Developers Basic Tutorial: From @BotFather to 'Hello World' Code Examples Telegram Telegram is a cloud-based mobile and desktop messaging app with a focus on security and speed.

See also: A General Bot Platform Overview Full API Reference for Developers What features do bots have? Inputs Text Commands Buttons Chat and User Selection Interactions Inline Deep Linking Attachment Menu Integration Mini Apps Bots for Business Payments Web Login HTML5 Games Stickers Monetization Language Support Bot Management Privacy Mode Testing Your Bot Status Alerts Local API BotFather, creating and managing bots Inputs Users can send messages of all types to bots, including text, files, locations, stickers, voice messages and even dice if they're feeling lucky. However, Telegram bots offer many other tools for building flexible interfaces tailored to your specific needs: Commands that are highlighted in messages and can be selected from a list after typing / . Keyboards that replace the user's keyboard with predefined answer options. Buttons that are shown next to messages from the bot. For even more flexibility, Web Apps support 100% custom interfaces with JavaScript. Note: Telegram bots can support multiple languages that adapt to the users' language settings in the app. Commands A command is a simple /keyword that tells the bot what to do. Telegram apps will: Highlight commands in messages. When the user taps a highlighted command, that command is immediately sent again. Suggest a list of supported commands with descriptions when the user enters a / (for this to work, you need to have provided a list of commands to @BotFather or via the appropriate API method ). Selecting a command from the list immediately sends it. Show a menu button containing all or some of a bot’s commands (which you set via @BotFather ). Commands must always start with the / symbol and contain up to 32 characters . They can use Latin letters , numbers and underscores , though simple lowercase text is recommended for a cleaner look. Here are a few examples: /next /cancel /newlocation /newrule Commands should be as specific as possible – for example /newlocation or /newrule is better than a /new command that then requires an additional parameter from the user like \" location “ or ” rule \". We require all developers to support several Global Commands to make sure Telegram bots offer a consistent and user-friendly experience. Command Scopes Your bot is able to show different commands to different users and groups – you can control this using scopes . For example, your bot could show additional commands to group admins or translate the list based on the user’s language_code . Keep in mind that Bot API updates will not contain any information about the scope of a command sent by the user – in fact, they may contain commands that don’t exist at all in your bot. Your backend should always verify that received commands are valid and that the user was authorized to use them regardless of scope. Bots with privacy mode enabled will only receive commands in groups under special conditions, see here . Keyboards Bots are able to interpret free text input from users, but offering specific suggestions is often more intuitive – this is where custom keyboards can be extremely useful. Whenever your bot sends a message, it can display a special keyboard with predefined reply options (see ReplyKeyboardMarkup ). Telegram apps that receive the message will display your keyboard to the user. Using any of the buttons will immediately send the respective text. This way you can drastically simplify and streamline user interaction with your bot. Check out the one_time_keyboard parameter to automatically hide your bot's keyboard as soon as it's been used. You can also customize the text placeholder in the input field by setting the input_field_placeholder parameter. Inline Keyboards There are times when you'd prefer to do things without sending any messages to the chat – like when a user is changing settings, toggling options or navigating search results. In such cases, you can use Inline Keyboards that are shown directly below their relevant messages. Unlike with custom reply keyboards, pressing buttons on inline keyboards doesn't send messages to the chat . Instead, inline keyboards support buttons that can work behind the scenes or open different interfaces: callback buttons , URL buttons , switch-to-inline buttons , game buttons and payment buttons . To provide a better user experience , consider editing your keyboard when the user toggles a setting button or navigates to a new page – this is both faster and smoother than sending a whole new message and deleting the previous one. Menu Button In all bot chats, a menu button appears near the message field. By default, tapping this button opens a menu that can hold some or all of a bot's commands, including a short description for each. Users can then select a command from the menu without needing to type it out. You can set different texts of the menu button and its command descriptions for various individual users or groups of users – for example, showing translated text based on the user’s language, as explained here . The menu button can alternatively be used to launch a Web App . Global Commands To make basic interactions more uniform, we ask all developers to support a few basic commands . Telegram apps will have interface shortcuts for these commands. /start - begins the interaction with the user, like sending an introductory message. This command can also be used to pass additional parameters to the bot (see Deep Linking ). /help - returns a help message, like a short text about what your bot can do and a list of commands. /settings - (if applicable) shows the bot's settings for this user and suggests commands to edit them. Users will see a Start button the first time they open a chat with your bot. Help and Settings links will be available in the menu on the bot's profile page if you add them in @BotFather . Chat and User Selection Bots can present the user with a friendly and intuitive interface that lists any number of groups, channels or other users according to a custom set of criteria . Tapping on a chat will send its identifier to the bot in a service message and seamlessly close the interface. A group management bot is the perfect example : an admin could select a chat the bot should manage, and then select a user it should promote – this would happen without ever typing any text. Here is a quick start guide to use this feature: Pick a set of criteria and store them in a KeyboardButtonRequestChat object (or KeyboardButtonRequestUser for users). Create a KeyboardButton and store the criteria under request_chat or request_user respectively. Send a ReplyKeyboardMarkup that contains the button you just created. When the user selects a chat, you'll receive its identifier in a chat_shared or user_shared service message. link Keep in mind that the bot may not be able to use the identifier it receives if the corresponding chat or user is not already known or accessible by some other means. Interactions In addition to sending commands and messages to the chat with the bot, there are several ways of interacting with them without opening any specific chat or group. Inline mode allows sending requests to bots right from the input field – from any chat on Telegram. Deep linking allows special links that send certain parameters to the bot when opened. Attachment menu integration makes it possible to use bots from the attachment menu in chats. Inline Requests Users can interact with your bot via inline queries straight from the message field in any chat . All they need to do is start a message with your bot's @username and enter a keyword. Having received the query, your bot can return some results. As soon as the user selects one, it is sent to the relevant chat . This way, people can request and send content from your bot in any of their chats, groups or channels. Remember that inline functionality has to be enabled via @BotFather , or your bot will not receive inline Updates . Examples of inline bots include @gif , @bing and @wiki . Web App bots can also be used inline – try typing @durgerkingbot in any chat. Deep Linking Telegram bots have a deep linking mechanism that allows additional parameters to be passed to the bot on startup. It could be a command that launches the bot – or an authentication token to connect the user's Telegram account to their account on another platform. Each bot has a link that opens a conversation with it in Telegram – https://t.me/<bot_username> . Parameters can be added directly to this link to let your bot work with additional information on the fly, without any user input. A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ and - are allowed. We recommend using base64url to encode parameters with binary and other types of content. The parameter can be up to 64 characters long. Private Chats In private chats, you can use the start parameter to automatically pass any value to your bot whenever a user presses the link. For example, you could use: https://t.me/your_bot?start=airplane When someone opens a chat with your bot via this link, you will receive: /start airplane Groups In groups, you can add the parameter startgroup to this link. For example: https://t.me/your_bot?startgroup=spaceship Following a link with this parameter prompts the user to select a group to add the bot to – the resulting update will contain text in the form: /start@your_bot spaceship Web Apps also support deep linking, for more information check out our dedicated guide . Attachment Menu Certain bots can be added directly to a user’s attachment menu – giving them easy access to the bot in any chat. Currently, this option is restricted to certain approved bots , but may be expanded later. Try adding @DurgerKingBot to your attachment menu. Integration There are various ways of further integrating bots with Telegram and other services. Use Web Apps to replace any website. Build tools and integrate business services . Accept Payments via dozens of integrated third-party payment providers. Connect to Telegram using the Web Login functionality. Create gaming bots by integrating HTML5 Games . Help users create and manage Telegram Stickers . Monetization Telegram offers a robust ecosystem of monetization features, allowing any bot to support its development with multiple revenue streams . Telegram Stars Telegram Stars power all digital transactions between bots and users. Users can acquire Stars through in-app purchases via Apple and Google or via @PremiumBot . Bots can use the Stars they receive to increase message limits , send gifts to users or accept rewards in Toncoin. Digital Products Services can use their bot to sell digital goods and services – like online courses, commissioned artwork and items in games . Paid Media Bots can post paid photos and videos – and users are only allowed to view the media after paying to unlock it. This functionality is available to all bots – including bot admins in channels and bots managing Telegram Business accounts. Subscription Plans Developers are able to offer paid subscriptions to their bot – adding multiple tiers of content and features tailored to their audience. Revenue Sharing from Telegram Ads Developers can participate in revenue sharing from Telegram Ads – receiving 50% of the revenue from ads that appear in the chat with their bot. Mini Apps Mini Apps allow developers to create infinitely flexible interfaces that can be launched right inside Telegram – integrating seamlessly with the app and replacing any website . If your bot is a mini app, you can add a prominent Launch app button as well as demo videos and screenshots to the bot’s profile. To do this, go to @BotFather and set up your bot's Main Mini App . Mini apps are covered in detail in our dedicated guide – you should read it carefully to learn the wide variety of features they can offer. If you develop a mini app , be sure to follow our design guidelines – you'll want your custom interface to seamlessly integrate into the app to provide users the best possible experience. Seamless Integration With Telegram Mini apps integrate seamlessly with Telegram – from receiving detailed theme settings to using native dialogs for reading QR codes , controlling biometrics , sharing media directly to stories and more. When opened from a direct link in a group, mini apps can also use the chat_instance parameter to track of the current context, supporting shared usage by multiple chat members – to create live whiteboards, group orders, multiplayer games and much more. Mini App Previews Developers can upload screenshots and video demos of their mini app right from the bot's profile page – giving users an overview of the app's features and functionality. These media previews will be shown to any user who views your app – like in the Mini App Store or via Search. Previews support multiple languages – so you can upload translated versions of your previews that will be shown to users based on their app language . Mini App Store More than 500 million out of Telegram's 950 million users interact with mini apps every month. Successful mini apps have the chance to be highlighted in the Telegram Mini App Store – appearing for all users in the 'Apps' tab of Search. Featured mini apps are chosen based on how they enrich the Telegram ecosystem . To increase the chances of being featured, you must enable the Main Mini App in @BotFather , upload high-quality media demos showcasing your app to your bot's profile and accept payments in Telegram Stars . Check out our documentation to learn more about enabling Main Mini Apps and accepting payments in Stars. Home Screen Shortcuts Users can place direct shortcuts to specific mini apps on the home screen of their devices – accessing their favorite games and services in one tap . Customizable Loading Screens The loading screen of mini apps can be customized in @Botfather – where developers can add their own icon and set specific colors for both light and dark themes. To customize your loading screen, go to @Botfather > /mybots > Select bot > Bot Settings > Configure Mini App > Configure Splash Screen . You can tap on Open Splash Screen Preview to see the final result. Full-Screen Mode Mini apps are able to use the entire screen in portrait or landscape orientation – allowing for immersive games and media with expanded gestures and interfaces. Setting Emoji Status Users can set an emoji status inside mini apps or give an app permission to update it automatically . Developers can also integrate APIs from other services or request geolocation access – instantly changing a user's status when they start a game or leave the office . Sharing Media Media generated in mini apps can be shared in any chat – letting users effortlessly send referral codes and custom images to contacts, groups and channels. Alternatively, users can download it with a native popup. Sharing from Mini Apps to Stories Any media created by the mini app, like whiteboard snapshots, leaderboards and AI-generated videos can be opened with the native story editor via the shareToStory method – for users to share as a Telegram Story right from the mini app. Mini apps also receive a number of events , allowing them to instantly react to actions by the user. You can learn more about which events are available here . Geolocation Access Mini apps are able to receive location permissions from users – giving developers the ability to make location-based games and interactive maps for events. Device Motion Tracking Mini Apps can request acceleration , orientation and rotation data from devices in real time – unlocking support for motion controls and VR experiences . Device Hardware Info A user's device can send basic hardware info to mini apps, such as its processing power and memory capacity. Mini apps can then use this to optimize graphics and automatically adjust settings for the smoothest experience. Bots for Business Bots can enable Business Mode , allowing Telegram Business subscribers to connect them to their account – streamlining and automating private chat management and interactions with their clients. The account owner can specify which chats your bot can access – within those chats, the bot will receive all updates normally supported by the Bot API , except messages sent by itself and other bots. Depending on the business connection settings, your bot may also be able to send messages and do other actions on behalf of the account owner in chats that were active in the last 24h. Here is a quick start guide to integrate your bot with Telegram Business: Enable Business Mode for your bot in @BotFather . Handle incoming BusinessConnection updates, signaling that a user has established , edited or ended a Business Connection with your bot. Process business messages by handling business_message , edited_business_message and deleted_business_messages updates. Check your bot’s write permissions via can_reply in the latest BusinessConnection update. If allowed to, use the business_connection_id field in sendMessage , sendChatAction and other send methods to communicate on behalf of the Business user. Users who connect your bot to their account will see a quick action bar at the top of each managed chat – tapping on “Manage Bot” will redirect them to your bot, which will receive a deep link message in the format /start bizChat<user_chat_id> . Please keep in mind that operating bots on Telegram is subject to the Telegram Bot Developer Terms of Service . Specifically, for Telegram Business, make sure you have read and understood Section 5.4 . Payments If your bot or mini app sells digital goods and services , be sure to carry out the payment in Telegram Stars by specifying XTR as currency. In compliance with third-party store policies, Telegram does not support the sale of digital goods and services using other currencies. Telegram bots can accept payments with a sleek, streamlined interface that collects all necessary data from the user. Telegram doesn't collect any payment data – like the user's credit card information – and sends it directly to one of the supported payment providers . Here is a quick start guide to implement payments: Pick a provider and obtain the proper token as well as a test token from the \" Stripe TEST MODE \" provider. Implement payments via the appropriate API methods . Test your implementation by using your test token along with a test credit card . Then, to issue an invoice and process the order flow: Send an invoice to the user for the goods or services you are offering. Validate the order and accept the checkout via answerPreCheckoutQuery . Confirm the payment by checking for a successful payment service message . Ship the goods or provide the services. For more details, feel free to check out our full exhaustive guides for selling goods and services on Telegram – they include live checklists, parameters and in-depth method descriptions: Guide for digital goods and services Guide for physical goods and services Telegram does not directly process the payments, does not store data about orders and does not collect any fees. Invoices are forwarded directly to the payment provider. For this reason, disputes must be solved between the user, the bot developer and the payment provider. You can read more about this in the Privacy Policy . Web Login Telegram offers a flexible , lightweight and free framework to authenticate users on any website and app. This can be used to bridge your platform with Telegram, providing a smooth experience to your users. You can also freely rely on this framework to implement a fast and signup-free login on your site, regardless of its connection to Telegram. Widgets The Telegram login widget is a simple and secure way to authorize users on your website. Choose a bot – ideally its name and profile pic should match the website title and logo. Use the /setdomain command in @BotFather to pair the bot with your website domain. Configure your widget using our dedicated tool and embed it on your website. Inline Login When users open your website via an inline button , you can use the login_url parameter as an alternative to login widgets. This way, you'll be able to seamlessly authorize them on your website or app before the page even loads. Make sure to review our guide on authenticating the received data as well as our sample code . HTML5 Games Bots can serve as standalone gaming platforms – with our HTML5 Gaming API you can develop multiplayer or single-player games and let your users have fun comparing ranks , scores and much more. To get started, follow these simple steps: Send the /newgame command to @BotFather Provide a description text , an image or an optional gif to showcase its gameplay Send the game to users via the sendGame method or via an inline query When someone wants to play, you'll receive the appropriate game_short_name in a CallbackQuery To launch the game, provide the HTML5 Game URL as the url param of answerCallbackQuery Then, to handle highscores : Use setGameScore to post high scores in the chat with the game Use getGameHighScores to get in-game high score tables You can also embed a share button within your game, play around with custom inline buttons , URL parameters and much more. To get a better idea, make sure to check out: HTML5 Games Manual HTML5 Games Bot API Docs Check out @GameBot and @gamee for examples of what you can do using our Gaming Platform. Stickers and Custom Emoji Stickers and Custom Emoji are a distinctive Telegram feature used by millions of users to share artwork every day. Stickers and custom emoji take many forms – ranging from basic images to smooth vector animations and high-detail .WEBM videos . All these formats are supported by our Bot API , which allows bots to create , edit , delete and share new artwork packs on the fly. Telegram's Import API lets users migrate packs from other platforms and sticker apps. Creating a new pack To create a new pack , simply: Prepare your artwork following our technical requirements . Create a new sticker pack via createStickerSet . Set sticker_type to regular to create a sticker pack or to custom emoji to create a pack of custom emoji. Attach the files you wish to include in the pack as an array of InputSticker You can use addStickerToSet to add stickers or emoji later on. Additional features Regular stickers and custom emoji support keywords that users can type to quickly find the respective artwork – this can be useful when a sticker doesn't have obvious ties to a specific emoji. You can use the keywords parameter in InputSticker to specify them. Custom emoji additionally support adaptive colors – they will always match the current context (e.g., white on photos, accent color when used as status, etc.); to enable this feature, use the needs_repainting parameter in createStickerSet . Once you're done creating and sharing your artwork, don't forget to check out our remaining sticker methods to find out how to edit , delete and even reorder your pack. Note that these methods will only work on packs created by the bot that is calling them . Language Support Bots can tailor their interfaces to support multiple languages – updating inputs and information on the fly. A user’s language_code is included in every relevant update as an IETF language tag , allowing bots to adapt accordingly. We recommend that you follow our guidelines to provide the best user experience . Your interfaces, texts and inline results should adapt seamlessly to the language_code , without user intervention. Connected WebApps will receive the user's language_code – your HTML page should account for it. HTML5 Games can obtain language information if you specify it as a URL parameter . You can generate this parameter from the language_code field in the User object served with the initial game CallbackQuery . The bot's Name , Description and About text can be natively localized with the respective methods . Command lists can also be specified for individual languages – more on this here . The language_code is an optional field – it could be empty. If you target the general public, your code should always fall back to either the last recorded language tag or English (in this order) when the field is missing for a specific user. Bot Management Privacy Mode Bots are frequently added to groups to perform basic tasks or assist moderators – like automatically posting company announcements or even celebrating birthdays. By default, all bots added to groups run in Privacy Mode and only see relevant messages and commands: Commands explicitly meant for them (e.g., /command@this_bot ). General commands (e.g. /start ) if the bot was the last bot to send a message to the group. Inline messages sent via the bot. Replies to any messages implicitly or explicitly meant for this bot. All bots will also receive, regardless of privacy mode : All service messages. All messages from private chats. All messages from channels where they are a member. Privacy mode is enabled by default for all bots, except bots that were added to a group as admins (bot admins always receive all messages ). It can be disabled so that the bot receives all messages like an ordinary user (the bot will need to be re-added to the group for this change to take effect). We only recommend doing this in cases where it is absolutely necessary for your bot to work. In most cases, using the force reply option for the bot's messages should be more than enough. This mode not only increases user privacy, but also makes the bot more efficient by reducing the number of inputs it needs to process. Users can always see a bot’s current privacy setting in the list of group members. Testing your bot You can quickly test your bot without interfering with its users by simply running another instance of your code on a different bot account. To do so, create a new bot via @BotFather , obtain its token and use it in the testing instance of your code. All further testing and debugging can happen privately on the new bot, without affecting the original instance. If you need to share file references across bots, note that the file_id field is tied to a single bot id, so your test instance cannot use a shared file_id database to quickly send media – files must be individually reuploaded. Dedicated test environment Telegram also offers a dedicated test environment suitable for more advanced testing. Bots and users in this environment generally have more flexible restrictions – for example: When working with the test environment, you may use HTTP links without TLS to test your Web Apps or Web Login . Flood limits are not raised in the test environment, and may at times be stricter. To minimize how this impacts your bot, you should make sure that it handles errors with retry policies and does not depend on hardcoded limit values. Creating a bot in the test environment The test environment is completely separate from the main environment, so you will need to create a new user account and a new bot with @BotFather . To create an account and log in, use either of the following: iOS : tap 10 times on the Settings icon > Accounts > Login to another account > Test. Telegram Desktop : open ☰ Settings > Shift + Alt + Right click 'Add Account' and select 'Test Server'. macOS : click the Settings icon 10 times to open the Debug Menu, ⌘ + click 'Add Account' and log in via phone number. After logging in, simply create a new bot following the standard procedure and send your requests to the Test Bot API in this format: https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/test/METHOD_NAME When working with the test environment, you may use HTTP links without TLS in the url field of both LoginUrl and WebAppInfo . Status alerts Millions choose Telegram for its speed. To best benefit users, your bot also needs to be responsive . In order to help developers keep their bots in shape, @BotFather will send status alerts if it sees something is wrong. We check the number of replies and the request/response conversion rate for popular bots (~300 requests per minute, this value may change in the future). If your bot returns an abnormally low number , you will receive a notification from @BotFather . Responding to alerts By default, you will only get one alert per bot per hour . Each alert has the following buttons: Fixed - Use this if you found an issue with your bot and fixed it. If you press the fix button, we will resume sending alerts in the regular way so that you can see if your fix worked within 5-10 minutes instead of having to wait for an hour. Support - Use this to open a chat with @BotSupport if you don't see any issues with your bot or if you think the problem is on our side. Mute for 8h/1w - Use this if you can't fix your bot at the moment. This will disable all alerts for the bot in question for the specified period of time. We do not recommend using this option since your users may migrate to a more stable bot. You can unmute alerts in your bot's settings via @BotFather . Monitored issues We currently notify you about the following issues: Too few private messages are sent. Value: {value} - Your bot is sending far fewer messages than it did in previous weeks. This is useful for newsletter-style bots that send messages without prompts from users. The larger the value, the more significant the difference. Too few replies to incoming private messages . Conversion rate: {value} - Your bot is not replying to all messages that are being sent to it (the request/response conversion rate for your bot was too low for at least two of the last three 5-minute periods). To provide a good user experience, please respond to all messages that are sent to your bot. Respond to message updates by calling send… methods (e.g. sendMessage ). Too few answers to inline queries . Conversion rate: {value} - Your bot is not replying to all inline queries that are being sent to it, calculated in the same way as above. Respond to inline_query updates by calling answerInlineQuery . Too few answers to callback queries . Conversion rate: {value} Too few answers to callback game queries . Conversion rate: {value} - Your bot is not replying to all callback queries that are being sent to it (with or without games), calculated in the same way as above. Respond to callback_query updates by calling answerCallbackQuery . Local Bot API You can host and work with your own instance of our open-source Bot API . The source code is available here , along with a quick installation guide . After installing the server , remember to use the logOut method before redirecting requests to your new local API URL. Your local instance runs on port 8081 by default and will only accept HTTP requests, so a TLS termination proxy has to be used to handle remote HTTPS requests. By hosting our API locally you'll gain access to some upgrades , including: API Max File Download Max File Upload WHook URL WHook Port WHook Max Connections Official 20MB 50MB HTTPS 443,80,88,8443 1-100 Local Unlimited 2000MB HTTP Any port 1-100000 You can find an exhaustive list here . All limits may be subject to change in the future, so make sure to follow @BotNews . BotFather Below is a detailed guide to using @BotFather , Telegram’s tool for creating and managing bots. Creating a new bot Use the /newbot command to create a new bot. @BotFather will ask you for a name and username, then generate an authentication token for your new bot. The name of your bot is displayed in contact details and elsewhere. The username is a short name, used in search, mentions and t.me links. Usernames are 5-32 characters long and not case sensitive – but may only include Latin characters, numbers, and underscores. Your bot's username must end in 'bot’, like 'tetris_bot' or 'TetrisBot'. The token is a string, like 110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw , which is required to authorize the bot and send requests to the Bot API. Keep your token secure and store it safely, it can be used by anyone to control your bot. Unlike the bot’s name, the username cannot be changed later – so choose it carefully. When sending a request to api.telegram.org, remember to prefix the word ‘bot’ to your token. About text, description and profile media When new users open your bot, they will be met with a helpful description in a box titled “What can this bot do?”. Properly setting this field in @BotFather allows everyone to immediately get an idea of what your bot can do – your description should be brief , to the point and on topic . You can also add a photo or video to this field with Edit Description Picture in @BotFather . Additionally, just like normal users, bots also come with a short bio available on their profile. If you didn't specify this field while first creating your bot, you can set it at any time with the /setabouttext command in @BotFather . Users can interact with many bots and they won't have access to their description after starting them – having a quick reminder of the bot's purpose can be very useful. Note that both the Description and the About text can be natively localized – each user will automatically see the correct translation for their language. Bots can also have a profile picture – you should pick something unique and original so that users can find it in their chat list at a glance. Starting from April 21, 2023 ( Telegram 9.6 ), you can edit your bot directly from its profile page – including setting a custom profile video . Generating an authentication token If your existing token is compromised or you lost it for some reason, use the /token command to generate a new one. Transfer ownership You can transfer ownership of your bot to another user . To do this, send /mybots , select your bot, then transfer ownership . You can only transfer a bot to users who have interacted with it at least once. Transferring ownership will give full control of the bot to another user – they will be able to access the bot’s messages and even delete it. The transfer is permanent, so please consider it carefully. BotFather commands The remaining commands are pretty self-explanatory: /mybots – returns a list of your bots with handy controls to edit their settings. /mygames – does the same for your games. Edit bots To edit your bot, you have two options. You can use the available commands: /setname – change your bot's name . /setdescription – change the bot's description (short text up to 512 characters). Users will see this text at the beginning of the conversation with the bot, titled ' What can this bot do? '. /setabouttext – change the bot's about info , a shorter text up to 120 characters. Users will see this text on the bot's profile page. When they share your bot with someone, this text is sent together with the link. /setuserpic – change the bot's profile picture . /setcommands – change the list of commands supported by your bot. Users will see these commands as suggestions when they type / in the chat with your bot. See commands for more info. /setdomain – link a website domain to your bot. See the login widget section. /deletebot – delete your bot and free its username . Cannot be undone. Or you can use the /mybots command, tap on your bot and use the modern inline interface to edit it. Starting from April 21, 2023 ( Telegram 9.6 ), you can edit your bot's public-facing info directly from its profile page – including setting a custom profile video . Edit settings /setinline    – toggle inline mode for your bot. /setinlinegeo – request location data to provide location-based inline results. /setjoingroups – toggle whether your bot can be added to groups or not. All bots must be able to process direct messages, but if your bot was not designed to work in groups, you can disable this. /setinlinefeedback – toggle whether the API should send updates about the results chosen by users. See an in-depth explanation here . /setprivacy – set which messages your bot will receive when added to a group. See privacy-mode for more info. Manage games /newgame    – create a new game. /listgames  – see a list of your games. /editgame   – edit a game. /deletegame – delete an existing game. Please note that it may take a few minutes for changes to take effect. With this information, you are ready to proceed to our Full API Reference for Developers .

See earlier changes » Authorizing your bot Each bot is given a unique authentication token when it is created . The token looks something like 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11 , but we'll use simply <token> in this document instead. You can learn about obtaining tokens and generating new ones in this document . Making requests All queries to the Telegram Bot API must be served over HTTPS and need to be presented in this form: https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/METHOD_NAME . Like this for example: https://api.telegram.org/bot123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11/getMe We support GET and POST HTTP methods. We support four ways of passing parameters in Bot API requests: URL query string application/x-www-form-urlencoded application/json (except for uploading files) multipart/form-data (use to upload files) The response contains a JSON object, which always has a Boolean field 'ok' and may have an optional String field 'description' with a human-readable description of the result. If 'ok' equals True , the request was successful and the result of the query can be found in the 'result' field. In case of an unsuccessful request, 'ok' equals false and the error is explained in the 'description'. An Integer 'error_code' field is also returned, but its contents are subject to change in the future. Some errors may also have an optional field 'parameters' of the type ResponseParameters , which can help to automatically handle the error. All methods in the Bot API are case-insensitive. All queries must be made using UTF-8. Making requests when getting updates If you're using webhooks , you can perform a request to the Bot API while sending an answer to the webhook. Use either application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data response content type for passing parameters. Specify the method to be invoked in the method parameter of the request. It's not possible to know that such a request was successful or get its result. Please see our FAQ for examples. Using a Local Bot API Server The Bot API server source code is available at telegram-bot-api . You can run it locally and send the requests to your own server instead of https://api.telegram.org . If you switch to a local Bot API server, your bot will be able to: Download files without a size limit. Upload files up to 2000 MB. Upload files using their local path and the file URI scheme . Use an HTTP URL for the webhook. Use any local IP address for the webhook. Use any port for the webhook. Set max_webhook_connections up to 100000. Receive the absolute local path as a value of the file_path field without the need to download the file after a getFile request. Do I need a Local Bot API Server The majority of bots will be OK with the default configuration, running on our servers. But if you feel that you need one of these features , you're welcome to switch to your own at any time. Getting updates There are two mutually exclusive ways of receiving updates for your bot - the getUpdates method on one hand and webhooks on the other. Incoming updates are stored on the server until the bot receives them either way, but they will not be kept longer than 24 hours. Regardless of which option you choose, you will receive JSON-serialized Update objects as a result. Update This object represents an incoming update. At most one of the optional parameters can be present in any given update. Field Type Description update_id Integer The update's unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a certain positive number and increase sequentially. This identifier becomes especially handy if you're using webhooks , since it allows you to ignore repeated updates or to restore the correct update sequence, should they get out of order. If there are no new updates for at least a week, then identifier of the next update will be chosen randomly instead of sequentially. message Message Optional . New incoming message of any kind - text, photo, sticker, etc. edited_message Message Optional . New version of a message that is known to the bot and was edited. This update may at times be triggered by changes to message fields that are either unavailable or not actively used by your bot. channel_post Message Optional . New incoming channel post of any kind - text, photo, sticker, etc. edited_channel_post Message Optional . New version of a channel post that is known to the bot and was edited. This update may at times be triggered by changes to message fields that are either unavailable or not actively used by your bot. business_connection BusinessConnection Optional . The bot was connected to or disconnected from a business account, or a user edited an existing connection with the bot business_message Message Optional . New message from a connected business account edited_business_message Message Optional . New version of a message from a connected business account deleted_business_messages BusinessMessagesDeleted Optional . Messages were deleted from a connected business account message_reaction MessageReactionUpdated Optional . A reaction to a message was changed by a user. The bot must be an administrator in the chat and must explicitly specify \"message_reaction\" in the list of allowed_updates to receive these updates. The update isn't received for reactions set by bots. message_reaction_count MessageReactionCountUpdated Optional . Reactions to a message with anonymous reactions were changed. The bot must be an administrator in the chat and must explicitly specify \"message_reaction_count\" in the list of allowed_updates to receive these updates. The updates are grouped and can be sent with delay up to a few minutes. inline_query InlineQuery Optional . New incoming inline query chosen_inline_result ChosenInlineResult Optional . The result of an inline query that was chosen by a user and sent to their chat partner. Please see our documentation on the feedback collecting for details on how to enable these updates for your bot. callback_query CallbackQuery Optional . New incoming callback query shipping_query ShippingQuery Optional . New incoming shipping query. Only for invoices with flexible price pre_checkout_query PreCheckoutQuery Optional . New incoming pre-checkout query. Contains full information about checkout purchased_paid_media PaidMediaPurchased Optional . A user purchased paid media with a non-empty payload sent by the bot in a non-channel chat poll Poll Optional . New poll state. Bots receive only updates about manually stopped polls and polls, which are sent by the bot poll_answer PollAnswer Optional . A user changed their answer in a non-anonymous poll. Bots receive new votes only in polls that were sent by the bot itself. my_chat_member ChatMemberUpdated Optional . The bot's chat member status was updated in a chat. For private chats, this update is received only when the bot is blocked or unblocked by the user. chat_member ChatMemberUpdated Optional . A chat member's status was updated in a chat. The bot must be an administrator in the chat and must explicitly specify \"chat_member\" in the list of allowed_updates to receive these updates. chat_join_request ChatJoinRequest Optional . A request to join the chat has been sent. The bot must have the can_invite_users administrator right in the chat to receive these updates. chat_boost ChatBoostUpdated Optional . A chat boost was added or changed. The bot must be an administrator in the chat to receive these updates. removed_chat_boost ChatBoostRemoved Optional . A boost was removed from a chat. The bot must be an administrator in the chat to receive these updates. getUpdates Use this method to receive incoming updates using long polling ( wiki ). Returns an Array of Update objects. Parameter Type Required Description offset Integer Optional Identifier of the first update to be returned. Must be greater by one than the highest among the identifiers of previously received updates. By default, updates starting with the earliest unconfirmed update are returned. An update is considered confirmed as soon as getUpdates is called with an offset higher than its update_id . The negative offset can be specified to retrieve updates starting from -offset update from the end of the updates queue. All previous updates will be forgotten. limit Integer Optional Limits the number of updates to be retrieved. Values between 1-100 are accepted. Defaults to 100. timeout Integer Optional Timeout in seconds for long polling. Defaults to 0, i.e. usual short polling. Should be positive, short polling should be used for testing purposes only. allowed_updates Array of String Optional A JSON-serialized list of the update types you want your bot to receive. For example, specify [\"message\", \"edited_channel_post\", \"callback_query\"] to only receive updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of available update types. Specify an empty list to receive all update types except chat_member , message_reaction , and message_reaction_count (default). If not specified, the previous setting will be used. Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to the getUpdates, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time. Notes 1. This method will not work if an outgoing webhook is set up. 2. In order to avoid getting duplicate updates, recalculate offset after each server response. setWebhook Use this method to specify a URL and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified URL, containing a JSON-serialized Update . In case of an unsuccessful request, we will give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns True on success. If you'd like to make sure that the webhook was set by you, you can specify secret data in the parameter secret_token . If specified, the request will contain a header “X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token” with the secret token as content. Parameter Type Required Description url String Yes HTTPS URL to send updates to. Use an empty string to remove webhook integration certificate InputFile Optional Upload your public key certificate so that the root certificate in use can be checked. See our self-signed guide for details. ip_address String Optional The fixed IP address which will be used to send webhook requests instead of the IP address resolved through DNS max_connections Integer Optional The maximum allowed number of simultaneous HTTPS connections to the webhook for update delivery, 1-100. Defaults to 40 . Use lower values to limit the load on your bot's server, and higher values to increase your bot's throughput. allowed_updates Array of String Optional A JSON-serialized list of the update types you want your bot to receive. For example, specify [\"message\", \"edited_channel_post\", \"callback_query\"] to only receive updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of available update types. Specify an empty list to receive all update types except chat_member , message_reaction , and message_reaction_count (default). If not specified, the previous setting will be used. Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to the setWebhook, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time. drop_pending_updates Boolean Optional Pass True to drop all pending updates secret_token String Optional A secret token to be sent in a header “X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token” in every webhook request, 1-256 characters. Only characters A-Z , a-z , 0-9 , _ and - are allowed. The header is useful to ensure that the request comes from a webhook set by you. Notes 1. You will not be able to receive updates using getUpdates for as long as an outgoing webhook is set up. 2. To use a self-signed certificate, you need to upload your public key certificate using certificate parameter. Please upload as InputFile, sending a String will not work. 3. Ports currently supported for webhooks : 443, 80, 88, 8443 . If you're having any trouble setting up webhooks, please check out this amazing guide to webhooks . deleteWebhook Use this method to remove webhook integration if you decide to switch back to getUpdates . Returns True on success. Parameter Type Required Description drop_pending_updates Boolean Optional Pass True to drop all pending updates getWebhookInfo Use this method to get current webhook status. Requires no parameters. On success, returns a WebhookInfo object. If the bot is using getUpdates , will return an object with the url field empty. WebhookInfo Describes the current status of a webhook. Field Type Description url String Webhook URL, may be empty if webhook is not set up has_custom_certificate Boolean True , if a custom certificate was provided for webhook certificate checks pending_update_count Integer Number of updates awaiting delivery ip_address String Optional . Currently used webhook IP address last_error_date Integer Optional . Unix time for the most recent error that happened when trying to deliver an update via webhook last_error_message String Optional . Error message in human-readable format for the most recent error that happened when trying to deliver an update via webhook last_synchronization_error_date Integer Optional . Unix time of the most recent error that happened when trying to synchronize available updates with Telegram datacenters max_connections Integer Optional . The maximum allowed number of simultaneous HTTPS connections to the webhook for update delivery allowed_updates Array of String Optional . A list of update types the bot is subscribed to.

Example: A poll bot for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll: Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish. Guide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you're ready'. The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use ForceReply in your bot's questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user.

Pass True if the uploaded video is suitable for streaming Sending files There are three ways to send files (photos, stickers, audio, media, etc.): If the file is already stored somewhere on the Telegram servers, you don't need to reupload it: each file object has a file_id field, simply pass this file_id as a parameter instead of uploading. There are no limits for files sent this way. Provide Telegram with an HTTP URL for the file to be sent. Telegram will download and send the file. 5 MB max size for photos and 20 MB max for other types of content. Post the file using multipart/form-data in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser. 10 MB max size for photos, 50 MB for other files. Sending by file_id It is not possible to change the file type when resending by file_id . I.e. a video can't be sent as a photo , a photo can't be sent as a document , etc. It is not possible to resend thumbnails. Resending a photo by file_id will send all of its sizes . file_id is unique for each individual bot and can't be transferred from one bot to another. file_id uniquely identifies a file, but a file can have different valid file_id s even for the same bot. Sending by URL When sending by URL the target file must have the correct MIME type (e.g., audio/mpeg for sendAudio , etc.). In sendDocument , sending by URL will currently only work for GIF , PDF and ZIP files. To use sendVoice , the file must have the type audio/ogg and be no more than 1MB in size. 1-20MB voice notes will be sent as files. Other configurations may work but we can't guarantee that they will.

Available methods All methods in the Bot API are case-insensitive. We support GET and POST HTTP methods. Use either URL query string or application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data for passing parameters in Bot API requests. On successful call, a JSON-object containing the result will be returned. getMe A simple method for testing your bot's authentication token. Requires no parameters. Returns basic information about the bot in form of a User object. logOut Use this method to log out from the cloud Bot API server before launching the bot locally. You must log out the bot before running it locally, otherwise there is no guarantee that the bot will receive updates. After a successful call, you can immediately log in on a local server, but will not be able to log in back to the cloud Bot API server for 10 minutes. Returns True on success. Requires no parameters. close Use this method to close the bot instance before moving it from one local server to another. You need to delete the webhook before calling this method to ensure that the bot isn't launched again after server restart. The method will return error 429 in the first 10 minutes after the bot is launched. Returns True on success. Requires no parameters. sendMessage Use this method to send text messages. On success, the sent Message is returned. Parameter Type Required Description business_connection_id String Optional Unique identifier of the business connection on behalf of which the message will be sent chat_id Integer or String Yes Unique identifier for the target chat or username of the target channel (in the format @channelusername ) message_thread_id Integer Optional Unique identifier for the target message thread (topic) of the forum; for forum supergroups only text String Yes Text of the message to be sent, 1-4096 characters after entities parsing parse_mode String Optional Mode for parsing entities in the message text. See formatting options for more details. entities Array of MessageEntity Optional A JSON-serialized list of special entities that appear in message text, which can be specified instead of parse_mode link_preview_options LinkPreviewOptions Optional Link preview generation options for the message disable_notification Boolean Optional Sends the message silently . Users will receive a notification with no sound. protect_content Boolean Optional Protects the contents of the sent message from forwarding and saving allow_paid_broadcast Boolean Optional Pass True to allow up to 1000 messages per second, ignoring broadcasting limits for a fee of 0.1 Telegram Stars per message. The relevant Stars will be withdrawn from the bot's balance message_effect_id String Optional Unique identifier of the message effect to be added to the message; for private chats only reply_parameters ReplyParameters Optional Description of the message to reply to reply_markup InlineKeyboardMarkup or ReplyKeyboardMarkup or ReplyKeyboardRemove or ForceReply Optional Additional interface options. A JSON-serialized object for an inline keyboard , custom reply keyboard , instructions to remove a reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user Formatting options The Bot API supports basic formatting for messages. You can use bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, spoiler text, block quotations as well as inline links and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages. Telegram clients will render them accordingly. You can specify text entities directly, or use markdown-style or HTML-style formatting. Note that Telegram clients will display an alert to the user before opening an inline link ('Open this link?' together with the full URL). Message entities can be nested, providing following restrictions are met: - If two entities have common characters, then one of them is fully contained inside another. - bold , italic , underline , strikethrough , and spoiler entities can contain and can be part of any other entities, except pre and code . - blockquote and expandable_blockquote entities can't be nested. - All other entities can't contain each other. Links tg://user?id=<user_id> can be used to mention a user by their identifier without using a username. Please note: These links will work only if they are used inside an inline link or in an inline keyboard button. For example, they will not work, when used in a message text. Unless the user is a member of the chat where they were mentioned, these mentions are only guaranteed to work if the user has contacted the bot in private in the past or has sent a callback query to the bot via an inline button and doesn't have Forwarded Messages privacy enabled for the bot. You can find the list of programming and markup languages for which syntax highlighting is supported at libprisma#supported-languages . MarkdownV2 style To use this mode, pass MarkdownV2 in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message: *bold \\*text*\n_italic \\*text_\n__underline__\n~strikethrough~\n||spoiler||\n*bold _italic bold ~italic bold strikethrough ||italic bold strikethrough spoiler||~ __underline italic bold___ bold*\n[inline URL](http://www.example.com/)\n[inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)\n![ ](tg://emoji?id=5368324170671202286)\n`inline fixed-width code`\n```\npre-formatted fixed-width code block\n```\n```python\npre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language\n```\n>Block quotation started\n>Block quotation continued\n>Block quotation continued\n>Block quotation continued\n>The last line of the block quotation\n**>The expandable block quotation started right after the previous block quotation\n>It is separated from the previous block quotation by an empty bold entity\n>Expandable block quotation continued\n>Hidden by default part of the expandable block quotation started\n>Expandable block quotation continued\n>The last line of the expandable block quotation with the expandability mark|| Please note: Any character with code between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a preceding '\\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary character and not a part of the markup. This implies that '\\' character usually must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character. Inside pre and code entities, all '`' and '\\' characters must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character. Inside the (...) part of the inline link and custom emoji definition, all ')' and '\\' must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character. In all other places characters '_', '*', '[', ']', '(', ')', '~', '`', '>', '#', '+', '-', '=', '|', '{', '}', '.', '!' must be escaped with the preceding character '\\'. In case of ambiguity between italic and underline entities __ is always greadily treated from left to right as beginning or end of an underline entity, so instead of ___italic underline___ use ___italic underline_**__ , adding an empty bold entity as a separator. A valid emoji must be provided as an alternative value for the custom emoji. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker . Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment . HTML style To use this mode, pass HTML in the parse_mode field. The following tags are currently supported: <b>bold</b>, <strong>bold</strong>\n<i>italic</i>, <em>italic</em>\n<u>underline</u>, <ins>underline</ins>\n<s>strikethrough</s>, <strike>strikethrough</strike>, <del>strikethrough</del>\n<span class=\"tg-spoiler\">spoiler</span>, <tg-spoiler>spoiler</tg-spoiler>\n<b>bold <i>italic bold <s>italic bold strikethrough <span class=\"tg-spoiler\">italic bold strikethrough spoiler</span></s> <u>underline italic bold</u></i> bold</b>\n<a href=\"http://www.example.com/\">inline URL</a>\n<a href=\"tg://user?id=123456789\">inline mention of a user</a>\n<tg-emoji emoji-id=\"5368324170671202286\"> </tg-emoji>\n<code>inline fixed-width code</code>\n<pre>pre-formatted fixed-width code block</pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language</code></pre>\n<blockquote>Block quotation started\\nBlock quotation continued\\nThe last line of the block quotation</blockquote>\n<blockquote expandable>Expandable block quotation started\\nExpandable block quotation continued\\nExpandable block quotation continued\\nHidden by default part of the block quotation started\\nExpandable block quotation continued\\nThe last line of the block quotation</blockquote> Please note: Only the tags mentioned above are currently supported. All < , > and & symbols that are not a part of a tag or an HTML entity must be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities ( < with &lt; , > with &gt; and & with &amp; ). All numerical HTML entities are supported. The API currently supports only the following named HTML entities: &lt; , &gt; , &amp; and &quot; . Use nested pre and code tags, to define programming language for pre entity. Programming language can't be specified for standalone code tags. A valid emoji must be used as the content of the tg-emoji tag. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the emoji field of the custom emoji sticker . Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on Fragment . Markdown style This is a legacy mode, retained for backward compatibility. To use this mode, pass Markdown in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message: *bold text*\n_italic text_\n[inline URL](http://www.example.com/)\n[inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)\n`inline fixed-width code`\n```\npre-formatted fixed-width code block\n```\n```python\npre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language\n``` Please note: Entities must not be nested, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead. There is no way to specify “underline”, “strikethrough”, “spoiler”, “blockquote”, “expandable_blockquote” and “custom_emoji” entities, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead. To escape characters '_', '*', '`', '[' outside of an entity, prepend the characters '\\' before them. Escaping inside entities is not allowed, so entity must be closed first and reopened again: use _snake_\\__case_ for italic snake_case and *2*\\**2=4* for bold 2*2=4 . Paid Broadcasts By default, all bots are able to broadcast up to 30 messages per second to their users. Developers can increase this limit by enabling Paid Broadcasts in @Botfather - allowing their bot to broadcast up to 1000 messages per second. Each message broadcasted over the free amount of 30 messages per second incurs a cost of 0.1 Stars per message, paid with Telegram Stars from the bot's balance. In order to use this feature, a bot must have at least 10,000 Stars on its balance. Bots with increased limits are only charged for messages that are broadcasted successfully. forwardMessage Use this method to forward messages of any kind.

Create games via @BotFather using the /newgame command. Please note that this kind of power requires responsibility: you will need to accept the terms for each game that your bots will be offering. Games are a new type of content on Telegram, represented by the Game and InlineQueryResultGame objects. Once you've created a game via BotFather , you can send games to chats as regular messages using the sendGame method, or use inline mode with InlineQueryResultGame . If you send the game message without any buttons, it will automatically have a 'Play GameName ' button. When this button is pressed, your bot gets a CallbackQuery with the game_short_name of the requested game. You provide the correct URL for this particular user and the app opens the game in the in-app browser. You can manually add multiple buttons to your game message. Please note that the first button in the first row must always launch the game, using the field callback_game in InlineKeyboardButton .

            "text_content": "Bots FAQ Twitter Home FAQ Apps API Protocol Schema Telegram Bots Bots FAQ Bots FAQ If you are new to Telegram bots, we recommend checking out our Introduction to Bots first. You may also find the Bot API Manual useful. General How do I create a bot? Where can I get some code examples? I have a feature request! What messages will my bot get? Why doesn't my bot see messages from other bots? Getting Updates How do I get updates? Long polling problems Webhook problems Using self-signed certificates How can I make sure webhook requests come from Telegram? Handling Media Downloading files Uploading large files Can I count of file_ids to be persistent? Broadcasting to Users How do I avoid hitting limits? How do I message all my subscribers? General Questions How do I create a bot? Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills at computer programming. In order for a bot to work, set up a bot account with @BotFather , then connect it to your backend server via our API . Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer. But we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with. I'm a developer. Where can I find some examples? Here are two sample bots, both written in PHP: Hello Bot demonstrates the basics of the Telegram bot API. Simple Poll bot is a more complete example, it supports both long-polling and Webhooks for updates. Many members of our community are building bots and publishing sources. We're collecting them on this page » Ping us on @BotSupport if you've built a bot and would like to share it with others. Will you add X to the Bot API? The bot API is still pretty young. There are many potential features to consider and implement. We'll be studying what people do with their bots for a while to see which directions will be most important for the platform. All bot developers are welcome to share ideas for our Bot API with our @BotSupport account. What messages will my bot get? 1. All bots , regardless of settings, will receive: All service messages. All messages from private chats with users. All messages from channels where they are a member. 2. Bot admins and bots with privacy mode disabled will receive all messages except messages sent by other bots. 3. Bots with privacy mode enabled will receive: Commands explicitly meant for them (e.g., /command@this_bot). General commands from users (e.g. /start) if the bot was the last bot to send a message to the group. Messages sent via this bot. Replies to any messages implicitly or explicitly meant for this bot. Note that each particular message can only be available to one privacy-enabled bot at a time, i.e., a reply to bot A containing an explicit command for bot B or sent via bot C will only be available to bot A. Replies have the highest priority. Why doesn't my bot see messages from other bots? Bots talking to each other could potentially get stuck in unwelcome loops. To avoid this, we decided that bots will not be able to see messages from other bots regardless of mode. Getting Updates How do I get updates? There are currently two ways of getting updates. You can either use long polling or Webhooks . Please note that it's not possible to get updates via long polling while an outgoing Webhook is set. Long polling gives me the same updates again and again! The getUpdates method returns the earliest 100 unconfirmed updates. To confirm an update, use the offset parameter when calling getUpdates like this: offset = update_id of last processed update + 1 All updates with update_id less than or equal to offset will be marked as confirmed on the server and will no longer be returned. I'm having problems with Webhooks. If you've set up your webhook successfully, but are not getting any updates, please remember: You need a valid SSL certificate for webhooks to work. To use a self-signed certificate, you need to upload your public key certificate using the certificate parameter in setWebhook . Please upload as InputFile, sending a String will not work. Ports currently supported for Webhooks: 443 , 80 , 88 , 8443 . Wildcard certificates may not be supported. Redirects are not supported. CN must exactly match your domain. Please check out this new WEBHOOK GUIDE to learn all there is to know about webhooks! I'm having trouble with my self-signed certificate! Please take a look at this self-signed certificate guide we made just for you. If you've read it and still have a question, ping us on botsupport. How can I make sure that Webhook requests are coming from Telegram? If you'd like to make sure that the Webhook request comes from Telegram, we recommend using a secret path in the URL you give us, e.g. www.example.com/your_token. Since nobody else knows your bot's token, you can be pretty sure it's us. How can I make requests in response to updates? This is possible if you're using webhooks. The upside is that you need less requests, the downside — that in this case it's not possible to know that such a request was successful or get its result. Whenever you receive a webhook update, you have two options: 1. Issue POST to https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/method 2. Reply directly and give method as JSON payload in the reply You may also want to look at our sample HelloBot , it offers a PHP implementation of this. Handling Media How do I download files? Use the getFile method. Please note that this will only work with files of up to 20 MB in size. How do I upload a large file? Bots can currently send files of any type of up to 50 MB in size, so yes, very large files won't work for now. Sorry. This limit may be changed in the future. Can I count on file_ids to be persistent? Yes, file_ids can be treated as persistent. Broadcasting to Users My bot is hitting limits, how do I avoid this? By default, bots are able to message their users at no cost – but have limitations on the number of messages they can broadcast in a single interval: In a single chat, avoid sending more than one message per second. We may allow short bursts that go over this limit, but eventually you'll begin receiving 429 errors. In a group, bots are not be able to send more than 20 messages per minute. For bulk notifications, bots are not able to broadcast more than about 30 messages per second, unless they enable paid broadcasts to increase the limit. How can I message all of my bot's subscribers at once? Enabling paid broadcasts in @BotFather allows a bot to broadcast up to 1000 messages per second . Each message broadcasted over the free amount of 30 per second incurs a cost of 0.1 Stars per message , paid with Telegram Stars from the bot's balance. In order to enable this feature, a bot must have at least 100,000 Stars on its balance and at least 100,000 monthly active users. Bots with increased limits are only charged for messages that are broadcasted successfully. If you do not wish to enable paid broadcasts, consider spreading them over longer intervals (e.g. 8-12 hours) to avoid hitting the limit. The API will not allow bulk notifications to more than ~30 users per second – if you go over that, you'll start getting 429 errors. If you've got questions that are not answered on this page, ping us at @BotSupport in Telegram. We welcome any suggestions for the Bot Platform and API.

Designing Mini Apps Color Schemes Mini Apps always receive data about the user's current color theme in real time, so you can adjust the appearance of your interfaces to match it. For example, when users switch between Day and Night modes or use various custom themes . Jump to technical information Design Guidelines Telegram apps are known for being snappy, smooth and following a consistent cross-platform design. Your Mini App should ideally reflect these principles. All elements should be responsive and designed with a mobile-first approach. Interactive elements should mimic the style, behavior, and intent of UI components that already exist. All included animations should be smooth, ideally 60fps. All inputs and images should contain labels for accessibility purposes. The app should deliver a seamless experience by monitoring the dynamic theme-based colors provided by the API and using them accordingly. Ensure that the app’s interface respects the safe area and content safe area to avoid overlapping with control elements, especially when using fullscreen mode. For Android devices, consider the additional information in the User-Agent (see User-Agent details ) and adjust for the device’s performance class, minimizing animations and visual effects on low-performance devices to ensure smooth performance. Implementing Mini Apps Telegram currently supports seven different ways of launching Mini Apps: the main Mini App from a profile button , from a keyboard button , from an inline button , from the bot menu button , via inline mode , from a direct link – and even from the attachment menu . Keyboard Button Mini Apps TL;DR: Mini Apps launched from a web_app type keyboard button can send data back to the bot in a service message using Telegram.WebApp.sendData . This makes it possible for the bot to produce a response without communicating with any external servers. Users can interact with bots using custom keyboards , buttons under bot messages , as well as by sending freeform text messages or any of the attachment types supported by Telegram: photos and videos, files, locations, contacts and polls. For even more flexibility, bots can utilize the full power of HTML5 to create user-friendly input interfaces. You can send a web_app type KeyboardButton that opens a Mini App from the specified URL. To transmit data from the user back to the bot, the Mini App can call the Telegram.WebApp.sendData method. Data will be transmitted to the bot as a String in a service message. The bot can continue communicating with the user after receiving it. Good for: Сustom data input interfaces (a personalized calendar for selecting dates; selecting data from a list with advanced search options; a randomizer that lets the user “spin a wheel” and chooses one of the available options, etc.) Reusable components that do not depend on a particular bot. Inline Button Mini Apps TL;DR: For more interactive Mini Apps like @DurgerKingBot , use a web_app type Inline KeyboardButton , which gets basic user information and can be used to send a message on behalf of the user to the chat with the bot. If receiving text data alone is insufficient or you need a more advanced and personalized interface, you can open a Mini App using a web_app type Inline KeyboardButton . From the button, a Mini App will open with the URL specified in the button. In addition to the user's theme settings , it will receive basic user information ( ID , name , username , language_code ) and a unique identifier for the session, query_id , which allows messages on behalf of the user to be sent back to the bot. The bot can call the Bot API method answerWebAppQuery to send an inline message from the user back to the bot and close the Mini App. After receiving the message, the bot can continue communicating with the user. Good for: Fully-fledged web services and integrations of any kind. The use cases are effectively unlimited . Launching Mini Apps from the Menu Button TL;DR: Mini Apps can be launched from a customized menu button. This simply offers a quicker way to access the app and is otherwise identical to launching a mini app from an inline button . By default, chats with bots always show a convenient menu button that provides quick access to all listed commands . With Bot API 6.0 , this button can be used to launch a Mini App instead. To configure the menu button, you must specify the text it should show and the Mini App URL. There are two ways to set these parameters: To customize the button for all users , use @BotFather (the /setmenubutton command or Bot Settings > Menu Button ). To customize the button for both all users and specific users , use the setChatMenuButton method in the Bot API. For example, change the button text according to the user's language, or show links to different Mini Apps based on a user's settings in your bot. Apart from this, Mini Apps opened via the menu button work in the exact same way as when using inline buttons . @DurgerKingBot allows launching its Mini App both from an inline button and from the menu button. Launching the main Mini App TL;DR: If your bot is a mini app, you can add a prominent Launch app button as well as high-quality demo videos and screenshots to the bot’s profile. To do this, go to @BotFather and set up your bot's Main Mini App . If your bot is a mini app, you can unlock a number of features that streamline and simplify the way in which users view and interact with it. To do this, go to @BotFather and set up your bot's Main Mini App . After setting a main mini app, you'll be able to upload detailed media preview demos to publicly highlight your app's key features on its profile. A Launch app button will also appear, allowing users to open your app directly from its profile. Bots that enabled a main mini app will be displayed in the Apps tab of the search for users who have launched them. Media previews support multiple languages – so you can upload translated versions of your previews that will be shown to users based on their app language . A bot's main Mini App can also be opened in the current chat by direct link in the format https://t.me/botusername?startapp . If a non-empty startapp parameter is included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam . Examples https://t.me/botusername?startapp https://t.me/botusername?startapp=command https://t.me/botusername?startapp=command&mode=compact In this mode, Mini Apps can use the chat_type and chat_instance parameters to keep track of the current chat context. This introduces support for concurrent and shared usage by multiple chat members – to create live whiteboards, group orders, multiplayer games and similar apps. By default, the main Mini App opens to full-screen height, and users cannot reduce them to half-height. However, you can change this behavior via @BotFather or by including the parameter mode=compact in the link to the Mini App, in which case it will open to half-screen height by default. Good for: Fully-fledged web services and integrations that any user can open in one tap. Cooperative, multiplayer or teamwork-oriented services within a chat context. The use cases are effectively unlimited . Successful bots which enable a main Mini App and accept payments in Telegram Stars may be featured in the Telegram Mini App Store . To increase the chances of being featured, we recommend uploading high-quality media showcasing your app on your bot's profile and following our design guidelines . Inline Mode Mini Apps TL;DR: Mini Apps launched via web_app type InlineQueryResultsButton can be used anywhere in inline mode. Users can create content in a web interface and then seamlessly send it to the current chat via inline mode. You can use the button parameter in the answerInlineQuery method to display a special 'Switch to Mini App' button either above or in place of the inline results. This button will open a Mini App from the specified URL. Once done, you can call the Telegram.WebApp.switchInlineQuery method to send the user back to inline mode. Inline Mini Apps have no access to the chat – they can't read messages or send new ones on behalf of the user. To send messages, the user must be redirected to inline mode and actively pick a result. Good for: Fully-fledged web services and integrations in inline mode. Direct Link Mini Apps TL;DR: Mini App Bots can be launched from a direct link in any chat. They support a startapp parameter and are aware of the current chat context. You can use direct links to open a Mini App directly in the current chat. If a non-empty startapp parameter is included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam . In this mode, Mini Apps can use the chat_type and chat_instance parameters to keep track of the current chat context. This introduces support for concurrent and shared usage by multiple chat members – to create live whiteboards, group orders, multiplayer games and similar apps. Mini Apps opened from a direct link have no access to the chat – they can't read messages or send new ones on behalf of the user. To send messages, the user must be redirected to inline mode and actively pick a result. Starting from Bot API 7.6 , by default, Mini Apps of this type open to full-screen height, and users cannot reduce them to half-height. However, you can change this behavior by including the parameter mode=compact in the link to the Mini App, in which case it will open to half-screen height by default. Examples https://t.me/botusername/appname https://t.me/botusername/appname?startapp=command https://t.me/botusername/appname?startapp=command&mode=compact Good for: Fully-fledged web services and integrations that any user can open in one tap. Cooperative, multiplayer or teamwork-oriented services within a chat context. The use cases are effectively unlimited . Launching Mini Apps from the Attachment Menu TL;DR: Mini App Bots can request to be added directly to a user's attachment menu, allowing them to be quickly launched from any chat. To try this mode, open this attachment menu link for @DurgerKingBot , then use the menu in any type of chat . Mini App Bots can request to be added directly to a user's attachment menu, allowing them to be quickly launched from any type of chat . You can configure in which types of chats your mini app can be started from the attachment menu (private, groups, supergroups or channels). Attachment menu integration is currently only available for major advertisers on the Telegram Ad Platform . However, all bots can use it in the test server environment . To enable this feature for your bot, open @BotFather from an account on the test server and send the /setattach command – or go to Bot Settings > Configure Attachment Menu . Then specify the URL that will be opened to launch the bot's Mini App via its icon in the attachment menu. You can add a 'Settings' item to the context menu of your Mini App using @BotFather . When users select this option from the menu, your bot will receive a settingsButtonClicked event. In addition to the user's theme settings , the bot will receive basic user information ( ID , name , username , language_code , photo ), as well as public info about the chat partner ( ID , name , username , photo ) or the chat info ( ID , type , title , username , photo ) and a unique identifier for the web view session query_id , which allows messages of any type to be sent to the chat on behalf of the user that opened the bot. The bot can call the Bot API method answerWebAppQuery , which sends an inline message from the user via the bot to the chat where it was launched and closes the Mini App. You can read more about adding bots to the attachment menu here . Initializing Mini Apps To connect your Mini App to the Telegram client, place the script telegram-web-app.js in the <head> tag before any other scripts, using this code: <script src=\"https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js?56\"></script> Once the script is connected, a window.Telegram.WebApp object will become available with the following fields: Field Type Description initData String A string with raw data transferred to the Mini App, convenient for validating data . WARNING: Validate data from this field before using it on the bot's server. initDataUnsafe WebAppInitData An object with input data transferred to the Mini App. WARNING: Data from this field should not be trusted. You should only use data from initData on the bot's server and only after it has been validated . version String The version of the Bot API available in the user's Telegram app. platform String The name of the platform of the user's Telegram app. colorScheme String The color scheme currently used in the Telegram app. Either “light” or “dark”. Also available as the CSS variable var(--tg-color-scheme) . themeParams ThemeParams An object containing the current theme settings used in the Telegram app. isActive NEW Boolean Bot API 8.0+ True , if the Mini App is currently active. False , if the Mini App is minimized. isExpanded Boolean True , if the Mini App is expanded to the maximum available height. False, if the Mini App occupies part of the screen and can be expanded to the full height using the expand() method. viewportHeight Float The current height of the visible area of the Mini App. Also available in CSS as the variable var(--tg-viewport-height) . The application can display just the top part of the Mini App, with its lower part remaining outside the screen area. From this position, the user can “pull” the Mini App to its maximum height, while the bot can do the same by calling the expand() method. As the position of the Mini App changes, the current height value of the visible area will be updated in real time. Please note that the refresh rate of this value is not sufficient to smoothly follow the lower border of the window. It should not be used to pin interface elements to the bottom of the visible area. It's more appropriate to use the value of the viewportStableHeight field for this purpose. viewportStableHeight Float The height of the visible area of the Mini App in its last stable state. Also available in CSS as a variable var(--tg-viewport-stable-height) . The application can display just the top part of the Mini App, with its lower part remaining outside the screen area. From this position, the user can “pull” the Mini App to its maximum height, while the bot can do the same by calling the expand() method. Unlike the value of viewportHeight , the value of viewportStableHeight does not change as the position of the Mini App changes with user gestures or during animations. The value of viewportStableHeight will be updated after all gestures and animations are completed and the Mini App reaches its final size. Note the event viewportChanged with the passed parameter isStateStable=true , which will allow you to track when the stable state of the height of the visible area changes. headerColor String Current header color in the #RRGGBB format. backgroundColor String Current background color in the #RRGGBB format. bottomBarColor String Current bottom bar color in the #RRGGBB format. isClosingConfirmationEnabled Boolean True , if the confirmation dialog is enabled while the user is trying to close the Mini App. False , if the confirmation dialog is disabled. isVerticalSwipesEnabled Boolean True , if vertical swipes to close or minimize the Mini App are enabled. False , if vertical swipes to close or minimize the Mini App are disabled. In any case, the user will still be able to minimize and close the Mini App by swiping the Mini App's header. isFullscreen NEW Boolean True , if the Mini App is currently being displayed in fullscreen mode. isOrientationLocked NEW Boolean True , if the Mini App’s orientation is currently locked. False , if orientation changes freely based on the device’s rotation. safeAreaInset NEW SafeAreaInset An object representing the device's safe area insets, accounting for system UI elements like notches or navigation bars. contentSafeAreaInset NEW ContentSafeAreaInset An object representing the safe area for displaying content within the app, free from overlapping Telegram UI elements.

Validating data received via the Mini App To validate data received via the Mini App, one should send the data from the Telegram.WebApp.initData field to the bot's backend. The data is a query string, which is composed of a series of field-value pairs. You can verify the integrity of the data received by comparing the received hash parameter with the hexadecimal representation of the HMAC-SHA-256 signature of the data-check-string with the secret key, which is the HMAC-SHA-256 signature of the bot's token with the constant string WebAppData used as a key. Data-check-string is a chain of all received fields, sorted alphabetically, in the format key=<value> with a line feed character ('\\n', 0x0A) used as separator – e.g., 'auth_date=<auth_date>\\nquery_id=<query_id>\\nuser=<user>' . The full check might look like: data_check_string = ...\nsecret_key = HMAC_SHA256(<bot_token>, \"WebAppData\")\nif (hex(HMAC_SHA256(data_check_string, secret_key)) == hash) {\n  // data is from Telegram\n} To prevent the use of outdated data, you can additionally check the auth_date field, which contains a Unix timestamp of when it was received by the Mini App. Once validated, the data may be used on your server. Complex data types are represented as JSON-serialized objects. Validating data for Third-Party Use NEW If you need to share the data with a third party, they can validate the data without requiring access to your bot's token . Simply provide them with the data from the Telegram.WebApp.initData field and your bot_id . The integrity of the data can be verified by validating the received signature parameter, which is the base64url-encoded representation of the Ed25519 signature of the data-check-string . The verification is performed using the public key provided by Telegram. Data-check-string is constructed as follows: 1. Prepend the bot_id , followed by : and the constant string WebAppData . 2. Add a line feed character ( '\\n' , 0x0A). 3. Append all received fields (except hash and signature ), sorted alphabetically, in the format key=<value> . 4. Separate each key-value pair with a line feed character ( '\\n' , 0x0A). Example: '12345678:WebAppData\\nauth_date=<auth_date>\\nquery_id=<query_id>\\nuser=<user>' The verification process might look like this: data_check_string = ...\npublic_key = \"<Telegram_public_key>\"\nif (Ed25519_verify(public_key, data_check_string, signature)) {\n  // data is valid and originated from Telegram\n} Telegram provides the following Ed25519 public keys for signature verification: Test environment: 40055058a4ee38156a06562e52eece92a771bcd8346a8c4615cb7376eddf72ec (hex) Production: e7bf03a2fa4602af4580703d88dda5bb59f32ed8b02a56c187fe7d34caed242d (hex) To prevent the use of outdated data, the third party should additionally validate the auth_date field. This field contains a Unix timestamp indicating when the data was received by the Mini App. Once validated, the data may be used. Complex data types are represented as JSON-serialized objects.

Adding Bots to the Attachment Menu Attachment menu integration is currently only available for major advertisers on the Telegram Ad Platform . However, all bots can use it in the test server environment . Talk to Botfather on the test server to set up the integration . A special link is used to add bots to the attachment menu: https://t.me/botusername?startattach or https://t.me/botusername?startattach=command For example, open this attachment menu link for @DurgerKingBot , then use the menu in any private chat . Opening the link prompts the user to add the bot to their attachment menu. If the bot has already been added, the attachment menu will open in the current chat and redirect to the bot there (if the link is opened from a 1-on-1 chat). If a non-empty startattach parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam . The following link formats are also supported: https://t.me/username?attach=botusername https://t.me/username?attach=botusername&startattach=command https://t.me/+1234567890?attach=botusername https://t.me/+1234567890?attach=botusername&startattach=command These links open the Mini App in the attachment menu in the chat with a specific user. If the bot wasn't already added to the attachment menu, the user will be prompted to do so. If a non-empty startattach parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam . Bot API 6.1+ supports a new link format: https://t.me/botusername?startattach&choose=users+bots https://t.me/botusername?startattach=command&choose=groups+channels Opening such a link prompts the user to choose a specific chat and opens the attachment menu in that chat. If the bot wasn't already added to the attachment menu, the user will be prompted to do so. You can specify which types of chats the user will be able to choose  from. It can be one or more of the following types: users , bots , groups , channels separated by a + sign. If a non-empty startattach parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam . Additional Data in User-Agent When the Mini App is running on Android, additional information is appended to the User-Agent string to provide more context about the app environment. This information includes the app version, device model, Android version, SDK version, and device performance class, formatted as follows: Telegram-Android/{app_version} ({manufacturer} {model}; Android {android_version}; SDK {sdk_version}; {performance_class}) where: {app_version} is the version of the Telegram app (e.g., 11.3.3 ), {manufacturer} {model} represents the device’s manufacturer and model (e.g., Google sdk_gphone64_arm64 ), {android_version} is the Android OS version running on the device (e.g., 14 ), {sdk_version} indicates the Android SDK version (e.g., 34 ), {performance_class} specifies the device performance class as LOW , AVERAGE , or HIGH , indicating the device's performance capacity. Example Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 14; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/113.0.5672.136 Mobile Safari/537.36 Telegram-Android/11.3.3 (Google sdk_gphone64_arm64; Android 14; SDK 34; LOW) We recommend using this information to optimize your Mini App based on the device's capabilities. For instance, you can adjust animations and visual effects in games on low-performance devices to ensure a smooth experience for all users, regardless of device specifications. Testing Mini Apps Using bots in the test environment To log in to the test environment, use either of the following: iOS: tap 10 times on the Settings icon > Accounts > Login to another account > Test.

For backward compatibility, it will be taken into account for a while, unless disable_edit_message is passed explicitly. Added the new field forward_from_message_id to Message . Added the new parameter cache_time to answerCallbackQuery . Will eventually work in Telegram apps — somewhere after version 3.14, maybe 3.15.

            "text_content": "Inline Bots Twitter Home FAQ Apps API Protocol Schema Telegram Bots Inline Bots Inline Bots Beyond sending commands in private messages or groups, users can interact with your bot via inline queries . If inline queries are enabled, users can call your bot by typing its username and a query in the text input field in any chat. The query is sent to your bot in an update. This way, people can request content from your bot in any of their chats, groups, or channels without sending any messages at all. To enable this option, send the /setinline command to @BotFather and provide the placeholder text that the user will see in the input field after typing your bot’s name. See the Bot API Manual for the relevant methods and objects. Inline results Inline bots support all types of content available in Telegram (20 in all). They are capable of sending stickers, videos, music, locations, documents and more. Clients can display the results with vertical or horizontal scrolling, depending on the type of content: As soon as the user taps on an item, it's immediately sent to the recipient, and the input field is cleared. Switching inline/PM modes Some inline bots can benefit from an initial setup process, like connecting them to an account on an external service (e.g., YouTube). We've added an easy way of switching between the private chat with a bot and whatever chat the user wants to share inline results in. You can display a special 'Switch to PM' button above the inline results (or instead of them). This button will open a private chat with the bot and pass a parameter of your choosing, so that you can prompt the user for the relevant setup actions. Once done, you can use an inline keyboard with a switch_inline_query button to send the user back to the original chat. Sample bots @youtube – Shows a 'Sign in to YouTube' button, then suggests personalized results. Manual: Switch to PM Location-based results Inline bots can request location data from their users. Use the /setinlinegeo command with @BotFather to enable this. Your bot will ask the user for permission to access their location whenever they send an inline request. Sample bot @foursquare – This bot will ask for permission to access the user's location, then provide geo-targeted results. Spreading virally Messages sent with the help of your bot will show its username next to the sender's name. When a user taps on the bot username in the message header, the mention is automatically inserted into the input field. Entering the @ symbol in the input field brings up a list of suggestions, featuring recently used inline bots. Collecting feedback To know which of the provided results your users are sending to their chat partners, send @Botfather the /setinlinefeedback command. With this enabled, you will receive updates on the results chosen by your users. Please note that this can create load issues for popular bots –  you may receive more results than actual requests due to caching (see the cache_time parameter in answerInlineQuery ). For these cases, we recommend adjusting the probability setting to receive 1/10, 1/100 or 1/1000 of the results. Inline bot samples Here are some sample inline bots, in case you’re curious to see one in action. Try any of these: @gif – GIF search @vid – Video search @pic – Yandex image search @bing – Bing image search @wiki – Wikipedia search @imdb – IMDB search @bold – Make bold, italic or fixed sys text NEW @youtube - Connect your account for personalized results @music - Search and send classical music @foursquare – Find and send venue addresses @sticker – Find and send stickers based on emoji Telegram Telegram is a cloud-based mobile and desktop messaging app with a focus on security and speed.

            "text_content": "Bot Payments API Twitter Home FAQ Apps API Protocol Schema Bot Payments API Telegram Bot Payments are a free and open platform that allows sellers to accept payments for goods and services from Telegram users. Telegram doesn't collect payment information and takes no commission . This page covers payments for physical goods and services – if you’re interested in selling digital goods and services , please check out our dedicated page . Note: This article is intended for bot developers and store owners. If you're looking for a general overview of Telegram Payments for physical goods and services, check out the Telegram blog . If you are new to Telegram bots and would like to learn how to create and set up a bot, please consult our Introduction to Bots and Bot FAQ . Payments for Physical Products Payments for physical goods and services were first added to Telegram in 2017 and allow bots to: Accept payments from over 200 countries using more than 20 providers. Send invoices to any chat , including groups and channels. Receive payments from users on mobile or desktop apps . Try @ShopBot to create a test invoice – or start a message with @ShopBot ... in any chat for an inline invoice . Check out Demo Shop for an example of a Telegram Channel used as virtual storefront . Check out @ShopBot for an example of a virtual storefront – then use our dedicated guides for digital and physical products to build your own. How does this work? You create a bot that offers goods and services to Telegram users. Merchant bots can send specially formatted invoice messages to users, groups or channels. If your bot supports inline mode , users can also send invoices to other chats via the bot , including to one-on-one chats with other users. Invoice messages feature a photo and description of the product along with a prominent Pay button. Tapping this button opens a special payment interface in the Telegram app. In this interface, users can choose a tip amount (if allowed by the merchant) and enter additional details like shipping info, phone number, or email address. The bot can offer several shipping options for physical goods based on the delivery address. When ready, users enter their credit card info or choose a saved card — and pay for the product. Telegram also supports Apple Pay and Google Pay . Once the transaction is done, the merchant bot can send a receipt message with payment details, shipping and delivery information. Detailed information and step-by-step instructions are available below. Payments Through Third-Party Providers Telegram does not process payments from users and instead allows developers to integrate directly with different third-party payment providers around the world. It is the payment providers that handle and store all sensitive information, like credit card details. Neither Telegram nor the bot developers have access to it. If you work for a company that provides services similar to standalone accounts in Stripe Connect , please let us know via @BotSupport (include the hashtag #paymentsprovider in your message). The Payments API This section explores payments via Telegram's Bot API in more detail. Connecting Payments To start accepting payments, you need a Telegram bot . Use BotFather to create a bot if you don't have one already. Now you have a merchant bot that can offer goods or services to Telegram users. Let's call it @merchantbot in this document. The first stop is to choose and connect a payment provider , you can find the list of supported providers above. Getting a Token Use the /mybots command in the chat with BotFather and choose the @merchantbot that will be offering goods or services. Go to Bot Settings > Payments . Choose a provider, and you will be redirected to the relevant bot. Enter the required details so that the payments provider is connected successfully, go back to the chat with Botfather. The message will now show available providers. Each will have a name, a token , and the date the provider was connected. You will use the token when working with the Bot API. Implementing Payments You will find the necessary methods for building your payment implementation in the Payments Section of the Bot API Manual . Testing Payments: the 'Stripe TEST MODE' Provider While you're still developing and testing payments for your bot, use the “Stripe TEST MODE” provider. When in this mode, you can make payments without actually billing any accounts. Real cards can't be used in test mode, but you can use test cards like 4242 4242 4242 4242 ( full list here ). You can switch between test mode and live mode as many times as you want, but please see the live checklist before you go live. Step-by-Step Process See Bot API: Payments for the complete list of available methods and objects. 1. Create Invoice The user contacts @merchantbot and requests to purchase something. The bot forms an invoice message with a description of the goods or service, amount to be paid, and requested shipping info. There are two ways of creating an invoice: A. Bot Invoice Use the sendInvoice method to generate an invoice and send it to a chat. The provider_token parameter is where you put the token value that you've obtained earlier via Botfather . It is possible for one merchant bot to use several different tokens for different users or different goods and services. Invoice messages with a pay button can be sent to chats of any type : private chats with the user, groups, or channels. The resulting invoice message will look like this: Bot Invoice B. Inline Invoice If @merchantbot supports inline mode , you can use inputInvoiceMessageContent to allow users to share invoices for your goods and services to their one-on-one chats with friends, or to their groups and channels. These invoices will have a Pay button that can be used multiple times. Inline Invoice 2. Choose Forwarding Behavior There are two ways for handling forwarded copies of your invoices, controlled by the parameter start_parameter in the sendInvoice method. A. Multi-chat invoice. Forwarded copies show a Pay button , which multiple users can press and attempt to pay for the goods or services. Inline invoices are always multi-chat invoices. B. Single-chat invoice. Invoice can only be paid from the chat to which it was sent, forwarded copies show a URL button with a deep link to the bot. The deep link can be used to generate a similar invoice in the chat with the bot, to show an error message, or for other purposes. More info on Deep Linking » If a single-chat invoice is sent to the chat with @merchantbot , it can only be paid once . If a single-chat invoice is sent to any other chat, it can be paid many times by many users. To get a better understanding of how this works, try toggling the “Pay from Forwards” parameter when creating invoices with our demo @ShopBot . Regardless of whether or not the Pay button is available in an invoice, the merchant bot always has the power to decide whether or not to accept new payments for a particular invoice. 3. Tips (optional step) If the max_tip_amount parameter is set to above 0 , users can add a tip to their payment. You can use the parameter suggested_tip_amounts to suggest particular amounts that you feel will be relevant for the invoice. Adding Tips 4. Shipping info and other details (optional step) The user specifies shipping information or other info requested by the bot. This could be the user's full name, an email address, a phone number in international format, or a full postal address for delivery. Shipping Info 5. Offer delivery options based on shipping address (optional step) If a shipping address was requested and you included the parameter is_flexible , the Bot API will send an Update with a shipping_query field to the bot. The bot must respond using answerShippingQuery either with a list of possible delivery options and the relevant delivery prices, or with an error (for example, if delivery to the specified address is not possible). Tip: It is recommended that the merchant bot confirms availability of the goods/services at this step – to let the user know in case they are no longer available. This is especially important if you are using multi-chat , inline or single-chat, multi-use invoices. 6. Select delivery option (optional step) The user selects a delivery option from the list (the overall amount to be paid may change at this point) and proceeds to checkout. Choose Delivery Option 7. Pre-Checkout The user enters their payment information and presses the final pay button. At this moment the Bot API sends an Update with the field pre_checkout_query to the bot that contains all the available information about the order. Your bot must reply using answerPrecheckoutQuery within 10 seconds after receiving this update or the transaction is canceled. The bot may return an error if it can't process the order for any reason. We highly recommend specifying a reason for failure to complete the order in human readable form (e.g. \"Sorry, we're all out of rubber ducks! Would you be interested in a cast iron bear instead?\" ). Telegram will display this reason to the user. Warning: It is critical to make sure your bot only accepts multiple payments when the order can be processed correctly. This is especially important if you are using multi-chat , inline or single-chat, multi-use invoices. 8. Checkout In case the bot confirms the order, Telegram requests the payment provider to complete the transaction. If the payment information was entered correctly and the payment goes through, the API will send a receipt message of the type successful_payment from the user. Once your bot receives this message, it should proceed with delivering the goods or services purchased by the user. If the invoice message was sent in the chat with @merchantbot , it becomes a Receipt in the UI for the user — they can open this receipt at any time and see all the details of the transaction: Receipt If the message was sent to any other chat, the Pay button remains and can be used again. It is up to the merchant bot whether to actually accept multiple payments. Going Live Once you've tested everything and confirmed that your payments implementation works, you're ready to switch to LIVE MODE. To do this, go to BotFather > /mybots > select @merchantbot > Bot Settings / Payments and enable Stripe LIVE MODE. You will get a token that has the string :LIVE: in the middle, e.g. 123:LIVE:XXXX . Do not give this token to any third parties! Before your merchant bot goes into live mode, please ensure the following: Live Checklist We highly recommend turning on 2-step verification for the Telegram account that controls your bot. You as the bot owner have full responsibility in case any conflicts or disputes arise. You must be prepared to correctly process disputes and chargebacks (in the case of Stripe, see here ). To prevent any misunderstandings and possible legal issues, make sure your bot can respond to a /terms command (or offers a similarly easy way of accessing your Terms and Conditions). Your Terms and Conditions should be written in a clear way and easy to understand for your users. The users must confirm that they have read and agree to your terms before they make the purchase. Your bot must provide support for its customers, either by responding to a /support command or by some other clearly communicated means. Users must have a clear way of contacting you about their purchases and you must process their support requests in a timely fashion. You must notify your users that Telegram support or bot support will not able to help them with purchases made via your bot. Make sure that your server hardware and software is stable. Use backups to make sure that you don't lose data about your users' payments. Make sure that you have completed the live checklist for your selected payments provider as well as this one. FAQ How do I join as a payment provider? If you work for a company that provides services similar to standalone accounts in Stripe Connect , please let us know via @BotSupport (kindly include the hashtag #paymentsprovider in your message). How much do you charge? Telegram does not charge any commission for using the Payments API. Note though, that most payment providers will have their own commissions. For example, Stripe in the US charges 2.9% + 30¢ per successful card charge (see the Stripe website for more details on pricing). Do I need a bot to accept payments? Yes. If you are not a developer, you will need to either hire someone to make a bot for you (recommended), or use a bot created by a third-party company. We advise extreme caution when using services of bots that process payments for you – Telegram doesn't maintain any such bots and doesn't endorse any of the third-party bots offering these services. What can my bot sell? Telegram does not impose any limits on what products or services your bot can offer. But please note that you must comply with the rules of the payments provider you choose in our system. E.g., Stripe has a special page for prohibited businesses – you may want to consult that one before you start selling harvested organs. Special Note: Due to Apple's limitations, bot developers are currently not allowed to accept payments for digital goods and virtual services from iOS users . UPD 2024: Thanks to recent changes in the Apple Review Guidelines, users will soon be able to pay for digital goods and services with Telegram Stars on all platforms. How are disputes handled? Telegram acts as a messenger between the paying user, the bot developer, and their chosen payment system. The user sends their credit card details directly to the payment system. Then the payment system's response and the shipping details entered by the user are passed to the bot developer so that they can process the order. Since Telegram doesn‘t process the payments, we don’t store and can‘t access any sensitive data. Due to this structure, it is impossible for Telegram to handle complaints or cashbacks – any disputed payments are the responsibility of the bot developers, payment providers, and banks that participated in the exchange. See also: Telegram Privacy Policy How do I support payments in my third-party app that uses the Telegram API? You are welcome to study the MTProto payment documentation . Supported Currencies Telegram payments currently support the currencies listed below (here's a JSON version in case you need it). If you're using Stripe as the payments provider, supported currencies may vary depending on the country you have specified in your Stripe account ( more info ). The minimum and maximum amounts for each of the currencies roughly correspond to the limit of US$ 1-10000 . The amount must be expressed in 12 digits or less, so the maximum value will be correspondingly lower for some lower-value currencies. Note that for each currency except USD these limits depend on exchange rates and may change over time (plan ahead for this when you implement limits in your code).

            "text_content": "Bot Payments API for Digital Goods and Services Twitter Home FAQ Apps API Protocol Schema Bot Payments API for Digital Goods and Services Telegram Bot Payments are a free and open platform that allows sellers to accept payments for goods and services from Telegram users. This page covers payments for digital goods and services – if you’re interested in selling physical goods and services , please check out our dedicated page . Note: This article is intended for bot developers and store owners. If you're looking for a general overview of Telegram Payments, check out the Telegram blog . If you are new to Telegram bots and would like to learn how to create and set up a bot, please consult our Introduction to Bots and Bot FAQ . Overview Payments are seamlessly integrated into Telegram, allowing you to sell digital goods and services in exchange for Telegram Stars , an in-app virtual item that you can later convert to a reward. With the Payments API, you’ll be able to: Send invoices to any chat , including to groups and channels. Create invoices that can be forwarded and used by multiple buyers to order things. Use inline mode to help users show your goods and services to their friends and communities. Accept payments from users on mobile or desktop apps . Try @DurgerKingBot to create a test invoice – or start a message with @DurgerKingBot ... in any chat for an inline invoice . Check out Demo Shop for an example of a Telegram Channel used as virtual storefront . Star Pricing Here is a table showing a breakdown of how much a user pays to acquire certain amounts of Stars, and the net proceeds received by the developer. Note that these amounts may vary from user to user due to VAT and other applicable fees that are outside of Telegram’s control. How does this work? You create a bot that offers digital goods and services to Telegram users. Merchant bots can send specially formatted invoice messages to users, groups or channels. If your bot supports inline mode , users can also send invoices to other chats via the bot , including to 1-on-1 chats with other users. Invoice messages feature a photo and description of the product along with a prominent Pay button. Tapping this button opens a special payment interface in the Telegram app. Since your bot sells digital goods and services, all transactions must be carried out in Telegram Stars, with currency tag XTR . Users can acquire Stars from Telegram using standard Apple and Google in-app purchases or via @PremiumBot and then use them to buy digital goods and services from you. The invoice interface for digital goods and services is seamless and doesn’t require users to enter any personal information, like their full name, shipping address or credit card details. Detailed information and step-by-step instructions are available below. The Payments API This section explores payments via Telegram's Bot API in more detail. This section is dedicated to the sale of digital goods and services – if you’re interested in selling physical goods and services , please check out our dedicated page . Creating a Telegram Bot To start accepting payments, you need a Telegram bot . Use @BotFather to create a bot if you don't have one already. For the purposes of this document, we will assume you named your bot @merchantbot . Implementing Payments You will find the necessary methods for building your payment implementation in the Payments Section of the Bot API Manual . In short, you must: Send an invoice via sendInvoice ( currency :  “XTR”) Await an Update with the field pre_checkout_query Approve or cancel the order via answerPreCheckoutQuery Await an Update with the field successful_payment Store the SuccessfulPayment ’s telegram_payment_charge_id – it may be needed to issue a refund in the future Deliver the goods and services purchased by the user You may find that some API methods for Payments request a provider_token . This parameter is only needed for sales of physical goods and services – for digital ones, you can leave it empty. Testing Payments You can freely test payments in Telegram Stars by connecting your bot to Telegram’s dedicated test environment. To find out more about how you can access and use the test environment, please reference our documentation . Step-by-Step Process See Bot API: Payments for the complete list of available methods and objects. Be sure to provide the proper set of parameters to account for the type of goods you are selling, differentiating between digital and physical orders. 1. Create Invoice The user contacts @merchantbot and requests to purchase something. The bot forms an invoice message with a description of the goods or service and amount to be paid (expressed in Telegram Stars). There are two ways of creating an invoice: A. Bot Invoice Use the sendInvoice method to generate an invoice and send it to a chat. You can pass an empty string as the provider_token parameter, since the invoice is for digital goods and services. Invoice messages with a pay button can be sent to chats of any type : private chats with the user, groups, or channels. The resulting invoice message will look like this: Bot Invoice Remember to specify XTR in the currency field, since all sales of digital goods and services are carried out exclusively in Telegram Stars. B. Inline Invoice If @merchantbot supports inline mode , you can use inputInvoiceMessageContent to allow users to share invoices for your goods and services to their one-on-one chats with friends, or to their groups and channels. These invoices will have a Pay button that can be used multiple times. Inline Invoice 2. Choose Forwarding Behavior There are two ways for handling forwarded copies of your invoices, controlled by the parameter start_parameter in the sendInvoice method. A. Multi-chat invoice. Forwarded copies show a Pay button , which multiple users can press and attempt to pay for the goods or services. Inline invoices are always multi-chat invoices. B. Single-chat invoice. Invoice can only be paid from the chat to which it was sent, forwarded copies show a URL button with a deep link to the bot. The deep link can be used to generate a similar invoice in the chat with the bot, to show an error message, or for other purposes. More info on Deep Linking » If a single-chat invoice is sent to the chat with @merchantbot , it can only be paid once . If a single-chat invoice is sent to any other chat, it can be paid many times by many users. To get a better understanding of how this works, try toggling the “Pay from Forwards” parameter when creating invoices with our demo @ShopBot . Regardless of whether or not the Pay button is available in an invoice, the merchant bot always has the power to decide whether or not to accept new payments for a particular invoice. 3. Pre-Checkout The user purchases Stars from Telegram (if necessary), then presses the pay button. At this moment the Bot API sends an Update with the field pre_checkout_query that contains all the available information about the order to the bot. Your bot must reply using answerPrecheckoutQuery within 10 seconds after receiving this update or the transaction is canceled. The bot may return an error if it can't process the order for any reason. We highly recommend specifying a reason for failure to complete the order in human readable form (e.g. \"Sorry, we're all out of rubber duck digital posters! Would you be interested in a cast iron bear digital poster instead?\" ). Telegram will display this reason to the user. Warning: It is critical to make sure your bot only accepts multiple payments when the order can be processed correctly. This is especially important if you are using multi-chat , inline or single-chat, multi-use invoices. 4. Checkout If the bot confirms the order and the payment is successful, the API will send a receipt message of the type successful_payment from the user. Once your bot receives this message, it should proceed with sending the digital goods or services purchased by the user. Warning: You must always check that you received a successful_payment update before delivering the goods or services purchased by the user – simply answering a pre_checkout_query does not guarantee a successful order or payment. If the invoice message was sent in the chat with @merchantbot , it becomes a Receipt in the UI for the user – they can open this receipt at any time and see all the details of the transaction: Receipt If the message was sent to any other chat, the Pay button remains and can be used again. It is up to the merchant bot whether to actually accept multiple payments. Going Live Once you've tested everything and confirmed that your payments implementation works, you're ready to go live – to do so, simply switch to the production environment. Before your merchant bot goes into live mode, please ensure the following: Live Checklist We highly recommend turning on 2-step verification for the Telegram account that controls your bot. You as the bot owner have full responsibility in case any conflicts or disputes arise. You must be prepared to correctly process disputes and chargebacks. To prevent any misunderstandings and possible legal issues, make sure your bot can respond to a /terms command (or offers a similarly easy way of accessing your Terms and Conditions). Your Terms and Conditions should be written in a clear way and easy to understand for your users. The users must confirm that they have read and agree to your terms before they make the purchase. Your bot must provide support for its customers, either by responding to a /support command or by some other clearly communicated means. Users must have a clear way of contacting you about their purchases and you must process their support requests in a timely fashion. You must notify your users that Telegram support or bot support will not be able to help them with purchases made via your bot. Verify your server hardware and software are stable. Use backups to make sure that you don't lose data about your users' payments. Make sure that you have read, understood and agreed to the Telegram Terms of Service and, by extension, to the Telegram Bot Platform Developer Terms of Service . FAQ Q: Can I use a different currency or payment provider? Payments for digital goods and services must be carried out exclusively in Telegram Stars. App stores like the Play Store for Android and the App Store for iOS have specific rules for developers regarding the sale of digital goods and services. Due to these rules, Telegram cannot display your bot or mini-app to mobile users if you attempt to sell digital goods and services via other currencies or through third-party payment providers. If you’re selling physical goods or services, you may use different currencies or payment providers. Please check out our dedicated document to learn more. Q: I run my own website to process sales, does this mean I don’t have to use Telegram Stars? To remain in compliance with Google’s Payment Policies 1, 2 and 4, along with Apple’s Review Guidelines 3.1.1, 3.1.1(a) and 3.1.3(b), your bot or mini app must use Telegram Stars for the sale of digital goods and services inside Telegram apps, regardless of any other web portals, apps, services or payment providers you may have set up outside the Telegram ecosystem. Q: Can I accept payment in cryptocurrency instead of Telegram Stars? No. All payments via bots and mini apps for digital goods and services inside Telegram apps must exclusively use Telegram Stars, in order to comply with the guidelines of the App Store and Play Store. For more details on what terms regulate your engagement with Telegram Stars, please reference Section 6.2. Digital Goods and Services of the Telegram Bot Platform Developer Terms of Service. Q: Do I need a bot to accept payments? Yes. If you are not a developer, you will need to either hire someone to make a bot for you (recommended), or use a bot created by a third-party company. We advise extreme caution when using services of bots that process payments for you – Telegram doesn't maintain any such bots and doesn't endorse any of the third-party bots offering these services. Q: How are disputes handled? You are solely responsible for processing and rectifying legitimate user disputes for digital goods and services sold by your bots or mini apps. Your bots and mini apps must be able to respond to the command /paysupport and process user requests regarding payment issues , and you must provide customer support in a timely fashion. The Telegram Bot API also allows you to easily and independently refund purchases that were made on your bot or mini app with Telegram Stars. For more details on customer disputes, please reference Section 6.2.1. Payment Disputes for Digital Goods and Services of the Telegram Bot Platform Developer Terms of Service. Q: How can I issue refunds? Refunds for digital goods and services can be issued via the refundStarPayment method on the Telegram Bot API. Q: What can I do with Telegram Stars? Stars can be used to place Telegram Ads for your TPA or to accept a reward for the monetary value that Telegram assigns to each Star. For more details on what terms regulate your engagement with Telegram Stars, please reference Section 6.2. Digital Goods and Services of the Telegram Bot Platform Developer Terms of Service. Q: How do I support payments in my third-party app that uses the Telegram API? You are welcome to study the MTProto payment documentation .

            "text_content": "Gaming Platform Twitter Home FAQ Apps API Protocol Schema Telegram Bots Gaming Platform Gaming Platform Bots can offer their users HTML5 games to play solo or to compete against each other in groups and one-on-one chats. Games are a new type of content on Telegram that your bot can send to users. Check out the @gamebot and @gamee bots for examples of what you can do using the new Gaming Platform. Web Apps Since April 2022 , you can also use Web Apps to create powerful games using JavaScript . Check out the Web App Manual for details. Creating a Game To get started, send the /newgame command to @BotFather .You will be prompted for a description text and a photo. You can also upload an optional GIF animation that demostrates your game to the users to make messages with the game more attractive (check out Lumberjack or Corsairs for examples). Launching the Game Once the game is created, your bot can send it to chats as regular messages, or offer them via inline mode . The game message will always have an inline Play button . When this button is pressed, your bot gets a callback query that indicates the requested game. You provide the correct URL for this particular user and the app automatically opens the game in the in-app browser. Adding Buttons If you send the game message without any buttons, it will automatically have a 'Play GameName ' button. You can manually add multiple buttons to your game message. Please note that the first button in the first row must always be the one that launches the game. You can add more buttons: e.g., for a description of the rules, or a button that links to the game's official community. Tracking High Scores The message with your game will also display high scores for the current chat. When a new high score is set, a service message will be sent to the chat and the message with the current scoreboard will be updated. You can also request the necessary data for building in-game high score tables. Sharing Your Game to Telegram Chats There are many way for users to spread your game virally if they like it. The interface will always have the standard system button for sharing the game in the top right corner: You can also create an additional Share button inside your HTML page. Pressing this button will send the game to a desired chat along with the user's best score in the game. To add the sharing button, include this script at the end of the <body> tag on your page: <script src=\"https://telegram.org/js/games.js\"></script> Then use the method TelegramGameProxy.shareScore() to call the sharing option. Warning: Do not call this method without consent and direct action from the user. Example: <button onclick=\"TelegramGameProxy.shareScore()\">Share score</button> This library will only work when launched from inside Telegram, so please don't use it on ordinary web pages. Using URL Parameters If your URL is using a fragment identifier, please note that Telegram Apps could add certain service parameters to the fragment id. The names for such parameters will start in tg (you can check the code that adds them here ). Use the TelegramGameProxy.initParams object if you need to read your own parameters from the fragment id. Creating a Great HTML5 Experience Please make sure that your HTML5 page is responsive and works well on all Telegram apps and supported platforms. If you find it impossible to support certain conditions or platforms, don't leave your users hanging and at least provide a notification. See the Bot API Manual for the relevant methods and objects. Telegram Telegram is a cloud-based mobile and desktop messaging app with a focus on security and speed.

If you already know your way around some of the basic steps, you can jump directly to the part you're missing. Equivalent examples are available in C# , Python , Go and TypeScript . Introduction Basic Tutorial Environment First Run Echo Bot Advanced Tutorial Commands Navigation Database Hosting Further Reading Introduction At its core, you can think of the Telegram Bot API as software that provides JSON-encoded responses to your queries. A bot, on the other hand, is essentially a routine, software or script that queries the API by means of an HTTPS request and waits for a response. There are several types of requests you can make, as well as many different objects that you can use and receive as responses. Since your browser is capable of sending HTTPS requests, you can use it to quickly try out the API. After obtaining your token , try pasting this string into your browser: https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getMe In theory, you could interact with the API with basic requests like this, either via your browser or other tailor-made tools like cURL . While this can work for simple requests like the example above, it's not practical for larger applications and doesn't scale well. For that reason, this guide will show you how to use libraries and frameworks , along with some basic programming skills , to build a more robust and scalable project. If you know how to code, you'll fly right through each step in no time – and if you're just starting out, this guide will show you everything you need to learn. We will use Java throughout this guide as it's one of the most popular programming languages, however, you can follow along with any language as all the steps are fundamentally the same. Since Java is fully cross-platform, each code example will work with any operating system. If you pick another language, equivalent examples are available in C# , Python , Go and TypeScript . Getting Ready First, we will briefly cover how to create your first project , obtain your API token and download all necessary dependencies and libraries . For the purposes of this guide, a copy of the bot you will be creating is also live at @TutorialBot – feel free to check it out along the way to see how your own implementation should look after each step. Obtain Your Bot Token In this context, a token is a string that authenticates your bot (not your account) on the bot API. Each bot has a unique token which can also be revoked at any time via @BotFather . Obtaining a token is as simple as contacting @BotFather , issuing the /newbot command and following the steps until you're given a new token. You can find a step-by-step guide here . Your token will look something like this: 4839574812:AAFD39kkdpWt3ywyRZergyOLMaJhac60qc Make sure to save your token in a secure place, treat it like a password and don't share it with anyone . Download an IDE To program in Java you'll need an IDE – a special text editor that will let you write, compile and run your code. In this tutorial, we'll use IntelliJ – there are several free, open source alternatives like Eclipse or NetBeans which work in the exact same way. You will also need a JDK , a software kit that allows your Java code to run. Most IDEs don't include a JDK, so you should download a version compatible with your operating system separately. You can find a free, open source version here . If you use another language, the steps are identical. You will just have to download a different IDE and software development kit. Pick a Framework or Library You can think of a framework as software that handles all the low-level logic for you, including the API calls, and lets you focus on your bot-specific logic. In this tutorial, we'll use TelegramBots , but you can follow along with any equivalent implementation, since all the underlying methods are either similar or exactly the same. You can find many frameworks, along with code examples, in our dedicated list . Create Your Project In IntelliJ, go to File > New > Project . Fill in the fields accordingly: Name - The name of your project. For example, BotTutorial . Location - Where to store your project. You can use the default value. Language - Java Build System - The framework that will handle your dependencies. Pick Maven . JDK - Pick whichever version you downloaded. We'll be using version 17 . Add Sample Code - Leave this selected , it will generate some needed files for you. Advanced Settings > GroupId - We suggest tutorial . Advanced Settings > ArtifactId - You can use the default value. After hitting Create , if you did everything correctly, your Project view in the top left should show a project structure along these lines: BotTutorial\n├─ .idea\n├─ src\n│  └─ main\n│     └─ java\n│        └─ tutorial\n│           └─ Main\n└─ pom.xml Other IDEs will follow a similar pattern. Your dependency management system will have a different name (or no name at all if it's built-in) depending on the language you chose. If this looks scary, don't worry. We will only be using the Main file and the pom.xml file. In fact, to check that everything is working so far, double click on Main and click on the small green arrow on the left of public class Main , then select the first option. If you followed the steps correctly, Hello world! should appear in the console below. Add Framework Dependency We will now instruct the IDE to download and configure everything needed to work with the API. This is very easy and happens automatically behind the scenes. First, locate your pom.xml file on the left side of the screen. Open it by double-clicking and simply add: <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.telegram</groupId>\n        <artifactId>telegrambots</artifactId>\n        <version>6.0.1</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies> right after the </properties> tag. When you're done, your pom.xml should look something like this . Start Coding We are ready to start coding. If you're a beginner, consider that being familiar with your language of choice will greatly help. With this tutorial, you'll be able to teach your bot basic behaviors, though more advanced features will require some coding experience. Creating a Bot Class If you're familiar with object-oriented programming , you'll know what a class is. If you've never heard of it before, consider a class as a file where you write some logic. To create the class that will contain the bot logic, right click on tutorial from the project tree on the left and select New > Java Class . Name it Bot and hit enter. Now we have to connect this class to the bot framework. In other words, we must make sure it extends TelegramLongPollingBot . To do that, just add extends TelegramLongPollingBot right after Bot . A red line will appear – it simply means we're missing some important methods. To fix this, hover over the red line, click on implement methods , then hit OK. Depending on the IDE, this option may be called implement missing methods or something similar. You should end up with this – if something went wrong, feel free to copy it from here and paste it in your class: package tutorial;\nimport org.telegram.telegrambots.bots.TelegramLongPollingBot;\nimport org.telegram.telegrambots.meta.api.objects.Update;\n\npublic class Bot extends TelegramLongPollingBot {\n\n  @Override\n  public String getBotUsername() {\n      return null;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String getBotToken() {\n      return null;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public void onUpdateReceived(Update update) {}\n\n} If you get a red line under TelegramLongPollingBot, it means you didn't set up your pom.xml correctly. If this is the case, restart from here . Available Methods Let's look into these 3 methods one by one. getBotUsername - This method must be edited to always return your bot's username. You should replace the null return value with it. getBotToken - This method will be used by the framework to retrieve your bot token. You should replace the null return value with the token. onUpdateReceived - This is the most important method. It will be called automatically whenever a new Update is available. Let's add a System.out.println(update); call in there to quickly show what we are getting. After you've replaced all the strings, you should end up with this: @Override\npublic String getBotUsername() {\n    return \"TutorialBot\";\n}\n\n@Override\npublic String getBotToken() {\n    return \"4839574812:AAFD39kkdpWt3ywyRZergyOLMaJhac60qc\";\n}\n\n@Override\npublic void onUpdateReceived(Update update) {\n    System.out.println(update);\n} At this point, the bot is configured and ready to go – time to register it on the API and start processing updates. In the future, you should consider storing your token in a dedicated settings file or in environment variables . Keeping it in the code is fine for the scope of this tutorial, however, it's not very versatile and is generally considered bad practice. Registering the Bot To register the bot on the API, simply add a couple of lines in the main method that will launch the application. If you named your class Bot , this is what your main method should look like: public static void main(String[] args) throws TelegramApiException {\n  TelegramBotsApi botsApi = new TelegramBotsApi(DefaultBotSession.class);\n  botsApi.registerBot(new Bot());\n} You can place this method in any class. Since we have an auto-generated main method in the Main class, we'll be using that one for this tutorial. First Run It's time to run your bot for the first time. Hit the green arrow to the left of public static void main and select the first option. And then there was nothing . Yes, a bit anticlimactic. This is because your bot has nothing to print – there are no new updates because nobody messaged it yet. If you try messaging the bot on Telegram, you'll then see new updates pop up in the console. At this point, you have your very own Telegram Bot – quite the achievement. Now, on to making it a bit more intelligent. If nothing pops up, make sure you messaged the right bot and that the token you pasted in the code is correct. Receiving Messages Every time someone sends a private message to your bot, your onUpdateReceived method will be called automatically and you'll be able to handle the update parameter, which contains the message , along with a great deal of other info which you can see detailed here . Let's focus on two values for now: The user - Who sent the message. Access it via update.getMessage().getFrom() . The message - What was sent. Access it via update.getMessage() . Knowing this, we can make it a bit more clear in the console output . @Override\npublic void onUpdateReceived(Update update) {\n    var msg = update.getMessage();\n    var user = msg.getFrom();\n\n    System.out.println(user.getFirstName() + \" wrote \" + msg.getText());\n} This is just a basic example – you can now play around with all the methods to see everything you can pull out of these objects. You can try getUsername , getLanguageCode , and dozens more. Knowing how to receive, process and print incoming messages , now it's time to learn how to answer them . Remember to stop and re-launch your bot after each change to the code. Sending Messages To send a private text message, you generally need three things : The user must have contacted your bot first. (Unless the user sent a join request to a group where your bot is an admin, but that's a more advanced scenario). You must have previously saved the User ID ( user.getId() ) A String object containing the message text, 1-4096 characters. With that out of the way, let's create a new method to send the first message: public void sendText(Long who, String what){\n   SendMessage sm = SendMessage.builder()\n                    .chatId(who.toString()) //Who are we sending a message to\n                    .text(what).build();    //Message content\n   try {\n        execute(sm);                        //Actually sending the message\n   } catch (TelegramApiException e) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(e);      //Any error will be printed here\n   }\n} And proceed to run this in the main method, right after registering the bot. For this example, we'll assume your User ID is 1234 . public static void main(String[] args) throws TelegramApiException {\n   TelegramBotsApi botsApi = new TelegramBotsApi(DefaultBotSession.class);\n   Bot bot = new Bot();                  //We moved this line out of the register method, to access it later\n   botsApi.registerBot(bot);            \n   bot.sendText(1234L, \"Hello World!\");  //The L just turns the Integer into a Long\n} If you did everything correctly, your bot should text you Hello World! every time you launch your code. Sending messages to groups or channels – assuming you have the relevant permissions – is as simple as replacing 1234 with the ID of the respective chat. Try experimenting with other types of messages, like SendPhoto, SendSticker, SendDice… A full list is available starting here . Echo Bot Let's practice everything we tried so far by coding an Echo Bot . Its functionality will be rather simple: every text message it receives will be sent right back to the user. Copying Text The most intuitive way of coding this is saving the User ID and calling sendText right after each update. In other words: @Override\npublic void onUpdateReceived(Update update) {\n    var msg = update.getMessage();\n    var user = msg.getFrom();\n    var id = user.getId();\n\n    sendText(id, msg.getText());\n} This works for text but can be extended to stickers, media and files. Copying Everything There are more specific functions that can be used to copy messages and send them back. Let's build a method to do just that: public void copyMessage(Long who, Integer msgId){\n   CopyMessage cm = CopyMessage.builder()\n              .fromChatId(who.toString())  //We copy from the user\n           .chatId(who.toString())      //And send it back to him\n           .messageId(msgId)            //Specifying what message\n           .build();\n    try {\n        execute(cm);\n    } catch (TelegramApiException e) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(e);\n    }\n} After replacing the method call in onUpdateReceived , running the code will result in a fully functional Echo Bot . This tutorial assumes that updates always contain messages for the sake of simplicity. This may not always be true – be sure to implement all the proper checks in your code to handle every type of update with the appropriate methods. Executing Commands To learn what a command is and how it works, we recommend reading this dedicated summary . In this guide, we'll focus on the technical side of things. Creating Your Command Begin by opening @BotFather . Type /mybots > Your_Bot_Name > Edit Bot > Edit Commands. Now send a new command, followed by a brief description. For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll implement two simple commands: scream - Speak, I'll scream right back \nwhisper - Shhhhhhh Command Logic We want the Echo Bot to reply in uppercase when it's in scream mode and normally otherwise. First, let's create a variable to store the current mode. public class Bot extends TelegramLongPollingBot {\n\n   private boolean screaming = false;\n\n   [...]\n} Then, let's change some logic to account for this mode . public void onUpdateReceived(Update update) {\n    [...]                                   //Same variables as the previous versions\n   if(screaming)                            //If we are screaming\n       scream(id, update.getMessage());     //Call a custom method\n   else\n       copyMessage(id, msg.getMessageId()); //Else proceed normally\n}\n\nprivate void scream(Long id, Message msg) {\n   if(msg.hasText())\n       sendText(id, msg.getText().toUpperCase());\n   else\n       copyMessage(id, msg.getMessageId());  //We can't really scream a sticker\n} Finally, let's add a couple more lines to the onUpdateReceived method to process each command before replying. if(msg.isCommand()){ \n   if(msg.getText().equals(\"/scream\"))         //If the command was /scream, we switch gears\n      screaming = true;\n   else if (msg.getText().equals(\"/whisper\"))  //Otherwise, we return to normal\n      screaming = false;\n\n   return;                                     //We don't want to echo commands, so we exit\n} As you can see, it checks if the message is a command . If it is, the bot enters scream mode . In the update method, we check which mode we are in and either copy the message or convert it to upper case before sending it back . And that's it. Now the bot can execute commands and change its behavior accordingly. Naturally, this simplified logic will change the bot's behavior for everyone – not just the person who sent the command. This can be fun for this tutorial but won't work in a production environment – consider using a Map, dictionary or equivalent data structure to assign settings for individual users. Remember to always implement a few basic global commands . You can practice by implementing a simple feedback to the /start command, which we intentionally left out. Buttons and Keyboards To streamline and simplify user interaction with your bot, you can replace many text-based exchanges with handy buttons. These buttons can perform a wide variety of actions and can be customized for each user. Button Types There are two main types of buttons: Reply Buttons - used to provide a list of predefined text reply options . Inline Buttons - used to offer quick navigation, shortcuts, URLs, games and so much more . Using these buttons is as easy as attaching a ReplyKeyboardMarkup or an InlineKeyboardMarkup to your SendMessage object. This guide will focus on inline buttons since they only require a few extra lines of code. Creating Buttons First of all, let's create some buttons. var next = InlineKeyboardButton.builder()\n            .text(\"Next\").callbackData(\"next\")           \n            .build();\n\n var back = InlineKeyboardButton.builder()\n            .text(\"Back\").callbackData(\"back\")\n            .build();\n\n var url = InlineKeyboardButton.builder()\n            .text(\"Tutorial\")\n            .url(\"https://core.telegram.org/bots/api\")\n            .build(); Let's go back through the fields we specified: Text - This is what the user will see, the text that appears on the button Callback Data - This will be sent back to the code instance as part of a new Update , so we can quickly identify what button was clicked. Url - A button that specifies a URL doesn't specify callbackdata since its behavior is predefined – it will open the given link when tapped. Creating Keyboards The buttons we created can be assembled into two keyboards , which will then be used to navigate back and forth between two sample menus . First, add two fields to store the necessary keyboards. private boolean screaming = false;\n\nprivate InlineKeyboardMarkup keyboardM1;\nprivate InlineKeyboardMarkup keyboardM2; Then, build and assign them. keyboardM1 = InlineKeyboardMarkup.builder()\n          .keyboardRow(List.of(next)).build();  \n\n//Buttons are wrapped in lists since each keyboard is a set of button rows\nkeyboardM2 = InlineKeyboardMarkup.builder()\n          .keyboardRow(List.of(back))\n          .keyboardRow(List.of(url))\n          .build(); You can place this code wherever you prefer, the important thing is making sure that keyboard variables are accessible from the method call that will send the new menu. If you're confused by this concept and don't know where to put them, just paste them above the command processing flow. Sending Keyboards Sending a keyboard only requires specifying a reply markup for the message. public void sendMenu(Long who, String txt, InlineKeyboardMarkup kb){\n    SendMessage sm = SendMessage.builder().chatId(who.toString())\n            .parseMode(\"HTML\").text(txt)\n            .replyMarkup(kb).build();\n\n    try {\n        execute(sm);\n    } catch (TelegramApiException e) {\n        throw new RuntimeException(e);\n    }\n} You may have noticed that we also added a new parameter, HTML . This is called a formatting option and will allow us to use HTML tags and add formatting to the text later on. Menu Trigger We could send a new menu for each new user, but for simplicity let's add a new command that will spawn a menu. We can achieve this by adding a new else clause to the previous command flow. var txt = msg.getText();\n if(msg.isCommand()) {\n        if (txt.equals(\"/scream\"))\n            screaming = true;\n        else if (txt.equals(\"/whisper\"))\n            screaming = false;\n        else if (txt.equals(\"/menu\"))\n            sendMenu(id, \"<b>Menu 1</b>\", keyboardM1);\n        return;\n } Try sending /menu to your bot now. If you did everything correctly, you should see a brand new menu pop up. In a production environment, commands should be handled with an appropriate design pattern that isolates them into different executor classes – modular and separated from the main logic. Navigation When building complex bots, navigation is essential. Your users must be able to move seamlessly from one menu to the next. In this example, we want the Next button to lead the user to the second menu. The Back button will send us back. To do that, we will start processing incoming CallbackQueries , which are the results we get after the user taps on a button. A CallbackQuery is essentially composed of three main parameters: queryId - Needed to close the query. You must always close new queries after processing them – if you don't, a loading symbol will keep showing on the user's side on top of each button. data - This identifies which button was pressed. from - The user who pressed the button. Processing in this context just means executing the action uniquely identified by the button, then closing the query . A very basic button handler could look something like: private void buttonTap(Long id, String queryId, String data, int msgId) {\n\n    EditMessageText newTxt = EditMessageText.builder()\n            .chatId(id.toString())\n            .messageId(msgId).text(\"\").build();\n\n    EditMessageReplyMarkup newKb = EditMessageReplyMarkup.builder()\n            .chatId(id.toString()).messageId(msgId).build();                           \n\n    if(data.equals(\"next\")) {\n        newTxt.setText(\"MENU 2\");\n        newKb.setReplyMarkup(keyboardM2);\n    } else if(data.equals(\"back\")) {\n        newTxt.setText(\"MENU 1\");\n        newKb.setReplyMarkup(keyboardM1);\n    }\n\n    AnswerCallbackQuery close = AnswerCallbackQuery.builder()\n            .callbackQueryId(queryId).build();\n\n    execute(close);\n    execute(newTxt);\n    execute(newKb);\n} With this handler, whenever a button is tapped, your bot will automatically navigate between inline menus. Expanding on this concept allows for endless combinations of navigable submenus, settings and dynamic pages. Database Telegram does not host an update database for you – once you process and consume an update, it will no longer be available. This means that features like user lists, message lists, current user inline menu, settings, etc. have to be implemented and maintained by bot developers. If your bot needs one of these features and you want to get started on data persistence , we recommend that you look into serialization practices and libraries for your language of choice, as well as available databases. Implementing a database is out of scope for this guide, however, several guides are available online for simple embedded open source software solutions like SQLite , HyperSQL , Derby and many more. Your language of choice will also influence which databases are available and supported – the list above assumes you followed this Java tutorial. Hosting So far, your bot has been running on your local machine – your PC. While this may be good for developing , testing and debugging , it is not ideal for a production environment. You'll want your bot to be available and responsive at all times, but your computer might not always be online. This can be done in four steps: Package your code Making your bot easy to move and runnable outside of an IDE is essential to host it elsewhere . If you followed this tutorial, this standard guide will work for you. If you didn't, look into export or packaging guides for your IDE and language of choice – procedures may vary but the end result is the same. Purchase a VPS or equivalent service A server is essentially a machine that is always online and running, without you having to worry about anything. To host your bot, you can opt for a VPS which serves this purpose and can be rented from several different providers. Another option would be to purchase a network-capable microcontroller , which come in all different specs and sizes depending on your needs. You should ensure that all user data remains heavily encrypted at all times in your database to guarantee the privacy of your users. The same concept applies to your local instance, however, this becomes especially important once you transfer your database to a remote server. Upload your executable/package Once you have a working ssh connection between your machine and your new server, you should upload your executable and all associated files. We will assume the runnable jar TutorialBot.jar and its database dbase.db are currently in the /TBot folder. $ scp -r /TBot/ username@server_ip:/bots/TBotRemote/ Run your application Depending on which language you chose, you might have to configure your server environment differently. If you chose Java, you just need to install a compatible JDK. $ apt install openjdk-17-jre\n$ java -version If you did everything correctly, you should see a Java version as the output, along with a few other values. This means you're ready to run your application. Now, to run the executable: $ cd /bots/TBotRemote/\n$ java -jar TutorialBot.jar Your bot is now online and users can interact with it at any time. To streamline and modularize this process, you could employ a specialized docker container or equivalent service. If you followed along in one of the equivalent examples ( C# , Python , Go and TypeScript ) you can find a detailed set of instructions to export and run your code here .
